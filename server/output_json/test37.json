    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  About Purplemath  About Elizabeth Stapel and Teaching  The primary developer of Purplemath and the author of its lessons is Elizabeth Stapel. Though she now has a master's degree in mathematics, she never would have believed while growing up that she would one day be a math teacher. In grammar school, her two worst subjects were math and phys ed \"physical education\" . For her high school years, her parents sent her to a religious school where the prevailing philosophy seemed to be that women needed to be married, not educated. Yes, those kinds of places still exist. Upon graduation, her parents put her to work at their church and then at their religious business. After five years of barely paying her, her parents finally had no further use for her and allowed her to try college, so she enrolled at the local state school. One of her first classes covered early high school algebra.  Ms. Stapel quickly discovered that, though she often found math to be difficult, she had a taste for the subject. She started helping fellow students through the university tutoring service, later becoming a grader for the math department. While grading homework for many professors' classes, she observed common problems that students have and common mistakes that they make. When she tutored, she again encountered these areas of difficulty, and was able to learn which techniques generally helped the students to succeed. These techniques were often those that Ms. Stapel had used to conquer her own confusion when earlier taking these same classes herself.  As a graduate student, Ms. Stapel worked in various tutoring and teaching capacities, and learned to incorporate her success techniques into her instruction, and these are the same tips and techniques that she weaves through her in class instruction and the Purplemath lessons. Her basic philosophy regarding algebra is \"If I can do this stuff, then so can you!\"  History of Purplemath  Purplemath began in 1998 as a personal web site created by Elizabeth Stapel. At a faculty meeting at Western International University, the instructors were encouraged to incorporate the Internet into their courses, so Ms. Stapel's initial site included quiz and homework solutions, announcements, syllabi, and other course specific materials for her math students at the various schools for which she worked at the time. Later, Ms. Stapel started adding a few lessons.  When Ms. Stapel later installed a visitor tracking service on her site, she was surprised to discover that people from around the world were coming to her site looking for those few lessons. This made Ms. Stapel feel that the lessons were the most important need that she should be serving, so she started writing more lessons. As more lessons were created, traffic at her personal site increased.  Eventually, she decided to do a complete site redesign to create a more professional appearance and to highlight the list of lessons. In doing the redesign, she needed to pick a color theme. She opened a color palette in the graphics program on her computer, and asked her , then about two and a half years old, which color he liked best. Naturally, he picked purple.  Traffic continued to increase, and in 1999 the site had to be moved from its free hosting to its own domain name. Ms. Stapel struggled to find a name, as all the obvious names, such as \"math.com\", \"algebra.com\", and \"tutor.com\", were already in use. Her husband suggested \"Purplemath\", which Ms. Stapel initially dismissed as being silly. But she couldn't think of anything else, and \"Purplemath\" is a hard name to forget, so the \"Purplemath\" name was duly registered. A few years later, \"Purplemaths\" with an \"s\" at the end was added for the benefit of British English speakers.  More lessons were added over time, the \"Homework Guidelines\" were streamlined, the reviews of Internet sites were reorganized and expanded, and the Study Skills Self Survey was created. The site design was updated again in September 2002, with minor changes being made in February 2004.  Purplemath served 3.8 million pageviews in 2003. Currently, Purplemath uses about 26 gigs of bandwidth a month, serves as many as 41,000 pageviews in a day, and averages about 8,400 visitors a day.  Recognition  Thousands of sites are now linked to Purplemath, and thousands of visitors come to the site each day. Purplemath has been listed as an online resource in such books as Cliffs Quick Review: Algebra II. In addition, the following awards and notations have been made:  Listed as a TechLearning \"Site of the Day\", February 2005  Added to EEVL's Mathematics listings, February 2005  Added to Homeschool.com's \"Top 100\" Web Sites list, September 2004  Rated by Education World as an \"A+\" site, October 2003  Added to the Internet Scout Report's archive of online educational resources, June 2003  Included in the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse's Digital Dozen, April 2003  Added to Kathy Schrock's Guide for Educators, April 2003  Listed as a Links2Learning \"Premier Page\", April 2002.  Selected as an Education Planet \"Top Math Site\", February 2002.  Listed as a PBS \"Recommended Site\", January 2002.  Mentioned in Wall Street Journal article, November 2001.  Chosen as a Learning in Motion \"Top Ten Selection\", October 2001.  Listed as an Internet Web Guide Magazine \"Molecule of the Month\" site, May 2001.  Placed on the \"Top20\" list for algebra, September 2000.  Listed as the Math Goodies newsletter \"Site of the Month\", August 2000.  Received the \"Web Site Excellence Award\" from The School Page, March 2000.  Software used in Site Design and Development  Many have inquired about the software used to create the various graphics on Purplemath. Graphs usually begin their life in the Equation Grapher program, produced by MFSoft International. Other graphics are created, and graphs are \"tweaked\", inside Paint Shop Pro, produced by Jasc Software. The animations are also created in Paint Shop Pro, through the Animation Shop plug in. Mathematical typesetting is done with MathType, produced by Design Science.  Page formatting is done within Namo's WebEditor.  Support Contact  Purplemath is, and hopes to remain, non commercial, and is supported almost entirely by the Stapels. are welcome, and donors may request for gifts of ten dollars or more.

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  William Stapel and Family  William playing \"Turkey in the Straw\" at our church's \"Western Sunday\" festivities. The pastor whistled along as William played.  William has switched from \"violin\" to \"fiddle\", and is greatly enjoying the faster pieces he's playing now, such as \"\". His playing has been a big hit .  February 2005  William competing in the \"8  & 9 year old Intermediate Forms\" category at a recent tournament.  William is wearing his \"Black Belt Club\" uniform. Being in the Black Belt Club allows him to go to special events like sleep overs where the kids stay up until three in the morning playing games, eating junk food, and watching karate movies.  January 2005  William participated in the 2005 homeschool spelling bee. He missed a word that he should have known, but the bees have helped him improve a lot in spelling.  January 2005  William with his cousin Steven, hiking the Apache Trail. William's father John drove Steven out on the Apache Trail to show him the desert wilds. Steven took lots of pictures for his mother back in Indiana, and helped William climb the rocks and trails. They took a break to cook hotdogs over a propane stove for lunch. Steven was very impressed by the scenery, as well as by John's driving skills: most people wouldn't take a family sedan out on the Trail!  July 2004  William, his father John, and his cousin Steven at the Grand Canyon. July 2004  Steven at a local fishing hole.  William looks forward to visiting Steven and Aunt Kathy in the summer, and exploring a countryside so different from that of his native Arizona.  Summer 2004  A mother hummingbird raised two chicks in a tiny nest she built on one of the blades of the ceiling fan on our back patio. One of the chicks is hiding his head here, but you can see two sets of tail feathers.  Summer 2004  William changed leagues to play with a team closer to home. He was awarded \"Most Improved Player\", but still needs to work on his throwing arm. He worked with a very nice coach.  As a homeschooler, William's schedule is very busy, so he's not sure if he'll go out for baseball again next spring.  Spring 2004  William is improving at reading technical instructions by learning how to wire circuits with his \"electronics lab\" kit. The only problem is in getting him to put all the pieces away when he's done.  November 2003  William got to meet and talk with astronaut Jon McBride at the Kennedy Space Center's \"Astronaut Encounter\". He made Mr. McBride laugh by asking him if he'd ever tried to sneak stuff onto the shuttle with him. We learned that the astronauts are given a tiny box in which they are allowed to carry things on board with them, such as commemorative coins.  October 2003  William went through eight flats of fish when feeding the dolphins at Sea World. The dolphins were very territorial, not wanting to \"share\" a feeder with another animal. They swallowed without closing their mouths, so there was no danger of missing the next fish.  October 2003  John and William on Grand Traverse Bay, Michigan. William played in the very shallow water, dug in the sand, and chased the ducks and the seagulls. He and his father also went out in the paddle boat.  June 2003  During our summer visit, Gramma took William to Kid's Kove, a fudge store, and a fun kid's museum. We all had a blast.  June 2003  Junior is the stray who adopted us almost a year before William was born. He was skin and bones at the time, but is very fat now. He tends to be nervous around adults, but likes children a lot. He has been a wonderful pet.  summer 2003  Meet William's cousins: Josh on the ground , Chris, Andy, Joey, Alex, and Casey on Alex's lap . In this picture, they're all in their back yard in Dearborn.  2003  Here are William's Bushi and Opa Polish \"Grandmother\" and Dutch \"Grandfather\" .  From our visit to Indiana clockwise, starting from the back : John William's father , Steven cousin , Kathy aunt , William, and Elizabeth mother .  summer 2003  Elizabeth Stapel  summer 2003  Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved "

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  Homework Guidelines for Mathematics  Mathematics is a language, and as such it has standards of writing which should be observed. In a writing class, one must respect the rules of grammar and punctuation, one must write in organized paragraphs built with complete sentences, and the final draft must be a neat paper with a title. Similarly, there are certain standards for mathematics assignments.  Write your name and class number clearly at the top of at least the first page, along with the assignment number, the section number s , or the page number s . If you are not stapling or paper clipping the pages together, then put your name or inititals on all the pages. Use standard sized paper  8.5\" x 11\" , with no \"fringe\" running down the side as a result of the paperï¿½s having been torn out of a spiral notebook, and do not use sticky notes, scented stationery, or other nonstandard types of paper. Use standard weight paper, not onion skin, construction paper, or otherwise abnormally thin or heavy paper. Attach your pages with a paper clip or staple. Do not fold, tear, spit on, or otherwise \"dog ear\" the pages. It is better that the pages be handed in loose with your name on each sheet than that the corners be folded or shredded. Clearly indicate the number of the exercise  you are doing. If you accidentally do a problem out of order, or separate part of the problem from the rest, then include a note to the grader, referring the grader to the missed problem or work. Write out the problems except in the case of word problems, which are too long . Do your work in pencil, with mistakes cleanly erased, not crossed or scratched out. If you work in ink, use \"white out\" to correct mistakes. Write legibly suitably large and suitably dark ; if the grader can't read your answer, it's wrong. Write neatly across the page , with each succeeding problem below the preceding one, not off to the right. Please do not work in multiple columns down the page like a newspaper ; your page should contain only one column. Keep work within the margins. If you run out of room at the end of a problem, please continue onto the next page; do not try to squeeze lines together at the bottom of the sheet. Do not lap over the margins on the left or right; do not wrap writing around the notebook holes. Do not squeeze the problems together, with one problem running into the next. Use sufficient space for each problem, with at least one blank line between one problem and the next. Do \"scratch work,\" but do it on scratch paper; hand in only the \"final draft.\" Show your steps, but any work that is scribbled in the margins belongs on scratch paper, not on your homework. Show your work. This means showing your steps, not just copying the question from the assignment, and then the answer from the back of the book. Show everything in between the question and the answer. Use complete English sentences if the meaning of the mathematical sentences is not otherwise clear. For your work to be complete, you need to explain your reasoning and make your computations clear. For tables and graphs, use a ruler to draw the straight lines, and clearly label the axes, the scale, and the points of interest. Use a consistent scale on the axes, and do a T chart, unless instructed otherwise. Also, make your table or graph large enough to be clear. If you can fit more than three or four graphs on one side of a sheet of paper, then you're drawing them too small. Do not invent your own notation and abbreviations, and then expect the grader to figure out what you meant. For instance, do not use \"#\" in your sentence if you mean \"pounds\" or \"numbers\". Do not use the \"equals\" sign \"=\" to mean \"indicates\", \"is\", \"leads to\", \"is related to\", or anything else in a sentence; use actual words. The equals sign should be used only in equations, and only to mean \"is equal to\". Do not do magic. Plus minus signs, \"= 0\", radicals, and denominators should not disappear in the middle of your calculations, only to mysteriously reappear at the end. Each step should be complete. If the problem is of the \"Explain\" or \"Write in your own words\" type, then copying the answer from the back of the book, or the definition from the chapter, is unacceptable. Write the answer in your words, not the text's. Remember to put your final answer at the end of your work, and mark it clearly by, for example, underlining it. Label your answer appropriately. If the answer is to a word problem, make sure to put appropriate units on the answer. For instance, if the problem involves money, then the answer should involve dollars or cents. In general, write your homework as though you're trying to convince someone that you know what you're talking about.  You should use your instructor or grader as a study aid, in addition to the text, study guides, study groups, and tutoring services. Your work is much easier to grade when you have made your work and reasoning clear, and any difficulties you have in completing the assignment can be better explained by the grader. More importantly, however, completely worked and corrected homework exercises make excellent study guides for the Final. Also, if you develop good habits while working on the homework, you will generally perform better on the tests.  In summary, schools today have made the development of essential skills, the provision of significant and meaningful learning experiences, and the development of the workforce some of its primary goals for student success. As such, they want their instructors to guide the students toward a higher level of confidence and competence. In math, that translates into a greater need for clarity in mathematical writing. The intention on these \"Homework Guidelines\" is that you and your instructor communicate better, and that you succeed both in your present mathematics courses and in future mathematical communication with co workers and clients.  For further information, review these of acceptable and unacceptable solutions, and this showing neat and messy papers.

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  \"Homework Guidelines\" Examples  1 Determine whether x = 0 is a solution of 5x ï¿½ 3 = 3x + 5. unacceptable solution N Hello? \"N\"? What does that mean? acceptable solution 5x ï¿½ 3 = 3x + 5  Ah, much better! Now we can see how to do this problem. Also, we can clearly see how to interpret the computational result, and the final answer is obvious. 5 0 ï¿½ 3 = 3 0 + 5  0 ï¿½ 3 = 0 + 5  but ï¿½3 does not equal 5  Since ï¿½3 does not equal 5, then x = 0 is NOT a solution to the equation.    2 Write an algebraic equation for the verbal expression: The distance traveled in t hours by a car traveling at 50 miles per hour. unacceptable solution 3 50t  Um, yes, but what's your point? acceptable solution time: t  rate r: 50  d = r ï¿½ t, so d = 50t  Much nicer! And now the final answer makes sense.   3 Suppose you are driving on a freeway to another town that is 150 miles from your home. After 30 minutes, you pass a freeway exit that you know is 25 miles from your home. Assuming that you continue at the same constant speed, how long will it take for the entire trip?  unacceptable solution 150m 30m 25m ????  At a guess, I'd say that this student doesn't have a clue. Too bad he didn't at least write down the appropriate formula; it might have given him a hint! acceptable solution 25 miles in 30 minutes 0.5 hours :  25 ï¿½ 0.5 = 50, so rate r = 50mph.  Beautiful! The work is done step by step, the reasoning is clear, and the final answer is clearly marked. d = rt and d = 150, so  150 = 50t, and 3 = t.  It will take three hours.    4 Subtract, as indicated. unacceptable solution ? 12167  Why the question mark? Where does this number come from? What on earth might the original question have been? acceptable solution Gross Profits  $72,089  The parentheses indicate that the  answer is a negative number, so that  this computation reflects a loss.  Now everything is clear. Operating Expenses  ï¿½84,256  $12,167   5 Use equations to obtain the solution. unacceptable solution 25% 78 1950 19.50  There is no equation, no conversion of the percent to a number, and the wrong answer is scratched out instead of erased. Also, there is little indication of what the actual question might have been. acceptable solution 25% of 78 is how much?  We can clearly see what the original question was: \"25% of 78 is how much?\" Since we can also see all the reasoning, we can see how to solve this problem. And the final answer is marked. 0.25 78 = x  0.25 78 = 19.5, so  25% of 78 is 19.5    6 The value of a storeï¿½s inventory increased from $50,000 to $62,000. By what percent did the value increase? unacceptable solution .24  Huh? acceptable solution 62,000 ï¿½ 50,000 = 12,000 increase  The work is done step by step, and the reasoning and answer are clear. Also, we can see that this is computed correctly, as a twenty four percent increase in value over the original value, which will help when reviewing how to do this sort of problem for the Final. 12,000 50,000 = 0.24, or 24%  The inventoryï¿½s value increased by 24%.    7 Write an algebraic expression for the verbal expression: The product of two natural numbers whose sum is 25.  unacceptable solution 25 x+y xy  Huh? Nothing is explained, the set up is confusing, and as a result, the final answer is unclear and incomplete. acceptable solution x + y = 25.  Now this makes sense! The reasoning is clear, and the answer is obviously marked. When you go back to study for the test, the clarity of this worked exercise will really help! Then y = 25 ï¿½ x.  Then the product is:  x 25 ï¿½ x   8 Write a mathematical model for the problem, and solve the problem:  One whole number is one fifth of another whole number. The difference between the two numbers is 76. Find the numbers.  unacceptable solution 1 5 76 x y=76  ??????  Why didnï¿½t this student try to get some help? He surely does not understand what is going on! If only he had started by labelling, he might have made some progress. acceptable solution one number: x  the other number: y  Ahh, thatï¿½s much better! By starting out with labelling, the problem became much clearer, and thus much easier. Not only was this student able to complete the problem correctly, but he is now much better prepared to study for the test. one number is one fifth of  another number: x = 1 5 y  That means that x is the smaller  number; so y ï¿½ x = 76.  Then y ï¿½ 1 5 y = 76  4 5 y = 76, y = 95.  Then x = 1 5 95 = 19.  The numbers are 95 and 19.  Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved "

His father objected to a career in music for his son and so Adewale left his hometown for Lagos where he became an apprentice musician with Chief S.L. Atolagbe and his Holy Rainbow. Soon Adewale hooked up with the father of Juju music, who gave him encouragement and taught him about arranging and composing. In 1977 Adewale, along with his good friend Sir Shina Peters, formed a new group Shina Adwale and the Superstars International. In the three years the band last3ed they issued nine recordings. In 1980 Adewale and Peters split up the group and went on to form their own seperate groups. By 1984 Adewale has refined his sound into something he dubbed \"Yo Pop\", which he described as a blend of funk, jazz, juju, reggae, and Afro beat Back to  Copyright Â© 1995 1998 Janet Planet "

    "fileDetails": " AIRTO MOREIRA  Airto Moreira was born in 1941 in southern Brazil in the small village of Itaipolis, Santa Catarina. He was drumming before he could even walk, beating his fists on the floor, which had his mother quite concerned! His grandmother, though, recognized his special talent and encouraged him to express himself with the sounds of his childhood in the woods of Ponta Grossa and then Curitiba. By the age of seven, Airto was already appearing regularly on the radio, at thirteen he sang in the band Jazz Estrela, and by sixteen, when he moved to Sao Paulo, he was playing jazz professionaly. By 1963 he had moved to Rio and it was just a short time later that he met his future wife, singer Flora Purim. In 1968 they moved to Los Angeles where Flora worked in a restaurant called Lost and Found and Airto did odd jobs and played around. The couple soon moved to New York where Airto was more successful in finding gigs, his first job was in a restaurant where he worked for food! Soon he began meeting musicians like Reggie Workman, Cedar Walton, and bassist Walter Booker. It was through Booker that Airto began to meet the greats, people like Cannonball Adderley, Lee Morgan, and Joe Zawinul. It was Zawinul who reccommended Airto to for a recording session in 1970. Davis soon invited Airto to join his group, which included such other jazz icons as Wayne Shorter, Dave Holland, , Chick Corea, and later, John McLaughlin and Keith Jarrett. Airto remained with the Davis group for two years and he appears on such Davis releases as Live At The Fillmore and Live Evil. Airto was invited to participate in the first Weather Report album with Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul. Soon after he joined Chick Corea's original Return To Forever group, which also featured Flora Purim, Joe Farrell, and Stanley Clarke. Together they recorded the albums Return To Forever and Light As A Feather. I had the good fortune to see both the original Weather Report and Return To Forever groups and Airto was a standout, even with those other jazz greats on the stage. What's interesting about Airto's percussion is it's lack of boundaries. He believes in something he calls Creative Percussion which means exactly what it sounds like. In concert Airto uses a large table on rolling legs that he designed. It holds a variety of strange implements, only some of which are actually percussion instruments. I've seen him use such 'everyday' items like a metal rack from a refrigerator, rubber hoses, wooden shoes, springs attached to tin cans, shakers made from beer cans with shot pellets inside , etc. Wherever he is he's always looking for anything that can make a unique sound. It's an attitude like this that will always keep Airto creative and young at heart. I highly reccommend a book by Airto, edited by Rick Mattingly: Airto: The Spirit of Percussion. It's part of the Master Class series by 21 Century Music Productions, PO Box 1816, Wayne, NJ 07470. An is maintained by E.Konishi, a big fan living in Japan, as he says...  \"This page is dedicated to the vibrant world of the greatest Brazilian couple.

The band lasted for over ten years and in that time left an indelible mark on modern music from Mali. Les Ambassadeurs' music was Manding influenced, latin tinged, with with lightness and swing, and despite the modern instruments you can clearly hear the strains of the original Manding music. By the late 1970s Keita became determined to crack the international market, the band made the move to Paris and changed their name to Les Ambassadeurs Internationaux. With Keita's outstanding voice and presence balanced by Manfila's cracker jack guitar work and the mornful sax solos all tied together by the overall Islamic sound, Les Ambassadeurs Internationaux became one of the most popular transplanted African bands in Paris. Problems soon cropped up between Keita and Manfila and soon Les Ambassadeurs Internationaux were no more. Salif Keita tours around the world regularly and he is definitely not to be missed.

It was a prescient choice as today Toure is known as the Bluesman of Africa because of his highly distinctive blues style that's a cross mix of the Arabic influenced Malian sound with reminicent of bluesmen such as John Lee Hooker, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Big Joe Williams. He most commonly tours with his brother on calabash, and cousin on congas.

Heavily influenced by the music of Bob Marley, Blondy considered himself a Rasta at an early age. So early, in fact, that he recorded six Reggae tunes while still in his teens. Blondy's parents were so concerned about his devotion to Reggae and the Rasta lifestyle that they committed him to a psychiatric hospital for two years! Early in 1970 Reggae began to be popular in West Africa and Blondy's popularity grew to the point where, in the early '80s he recorded his first single, Brigidier Sabari. In 1983, he followed with his first album, Jah Glory and began touring all over Africa. It was at this point that Alpha made a pilmrimage to Jamaica to record with at Tuff Gong Studios. The results of his efforts were the huge hit album, Cocody Rock, followed by Jerusalem and then Apartheid is Nazism. Blondy sings in Dioula, English, French, Arabic, and Hebrew. His band, The Solar System, is likewise international, with members hailing from Cameroon, England, France, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, and Togo. Alpha Blondy and The Solar System are tight and hot, and Alpha's status as the premiere African Reggae star is richly deserved. Try another site about  Back to  "

Specific Facts regarding B. anthracis the bacteria in Anthrax for Our Drum makers, Drummers, & Dance Community please scroll down to read or  and feel free to distribute! 25 February 2006 Specific Facts for the Drum makers, Drummers & Dance Community regarding B. anthracis the bacteria in Anthrax by Krista Retto, longtime West African dancer and close friend of Note from the author: I am not a doctor, but I have checked my facts as are cited at the end of this article. I endeavored to be extremely thorough, so this is long. Key points are bolded in case you prefer to scan through. This is in the plainest English possible, and certain medical scientific data are omitted in order to âgive the key pointsâ in plain English. It is not comprehensive. A simple Google search on b. anthracis inhalation will bring anyone to highly detailed scientific information for those who wish to read further. You may also search for splenic fever. You can utilize referenceslisted at the end. VadoDiomande is currently suffering from inhalational b. anthracis. Since this type of infection is extremely rare, difficult to contract, not visible, and hard to diagnose, my focus is on a somewhat less rare form of the infection.. Cutaneous or skin b. anthracis also poses a danger to the drum maker hide handler, but it is a highly invisible form as you will read and see, and is thus relatively easily combated. Initial Drum maker Safety Precautions   but read everything below!  As a community, we are working on finding out EXACTLY how to obtain the safest materials possibleâ¦meanwhile, take these other precautions.  #1 Priority   Work in a well ventilated space.  Use a Hepa Filter air purifier.  Use disposable gloves and a mask in all cases even if you think the skins are fine.  Use razor blades only once, or boil hair shaving cutting tools for 30 minutes after each use. Dispose of used blades wrapped in cardboard so sharp edges are covered and then in a plastic bag.  Wash exposed skin with soap and hot water regularly and wash all the clothes and shoes you wear when working regular machine washing of these clothes is okay .  Letâs Change The Words We Use! I will only use the name b. anthracis herein. Part of the unwieldy terror surrounding this tragedy with Vado Diomande is the word Anthrax. In everyday use, Anthrax is a biological weapon of terror. What makes b. anthracis different  Scientists prod the bacteria to release all water molecules from their cells, transforming them into hard, tiny beads that withstand a wide range of temperature and weather conditions. They then treat those beads and condense them into a powder or aerosol. This makes weapons grade Anthrax. Vado does NOT have this Anthrax. Vado has a naturally occurring bacteria called bacillus anthracis. This rod shaped bacteria is the base used by scientists. Thatâs how they are related, but saying âanthraxâ seems unnecessarily inflammatory. Okay, moving onâ¦so what is b. anthracis In plain English, what is this stuff B. anthracis is a bacteria that takes the form of spores. It is inactive, and can be found in soil or in a dead carcass. Before the animal died, it thrives off its blood and then the bacteria killed the animal. As the body decomposed, or the hide was taken from it, the spore then goes back to an inactive state on the hide and will re awaken if it gets oxygen again. To the drum maker and wool sorter, etc. this is the danger. I will repeat however, again and again, a RARE danger. Many drum makers would be sick otherwise, no ! There are three forms of human contracted b. anthracis that are a danger to us. We can get one of the three by a certain type of handling contaminated carcasses, hides, wool, hair, and bones; and ingesting contaminated meat. 1. b. anthracis of the human skin: If a drum maker handles an infected dead carcassâ hide, and they have an open wound, they can get cutaneous anthracis. It is dangerous, not deadly unless entirely left untreated, and is extremely visible. It begins as a painless, itchy, reddish brown bump that enlarges and becomes swollen. The lesion usually turns into a blister then opens and becomes black in the center It can be readily diagnosed, and responds very quickly and with a 95 plus % efficacy, to antiobiotics. Smart Idea: Wear gloves and proper clothing when handling unprocessed skins before they are soaked and during shaving, on the remote chance...â¦. 2. and 3. Other types of b. anthracis: There are two other types of b. anthracis infections to humans: gastrointestinal and inhalational. Gastrointestinal is the rarest, and comes from eating infected, undercooked meat usually of caribou, goat or perhaps cow . It does not occur frequently because the cooking, even undercooking, seems to usually kill enough of the bacteria. I suppose there are other reasons as well that I did not endeavor to look up. However, if contracted, this strain is virulent. Smart Idea: People, cook your meat because even a one in a million chance is one too many. Ask for medium to well done in a restaurant. Inhalation b. anthracis weâll talk about next. Inhalation b. anthracis is very, very, very rare. Here are the key points to know:  In order to contract enough bacteria, there are certain conditions that allow for it. First, the animal gets infected by grazing the spores in the soil. Once itâs infected via grazing on the soil , the animal will die. It can then re enter the soil or be passed by taking its hide, or via other scavenger animals. This can happen in almost any country. Itâs a naturally occuring phenomena, and rare. Spores are inactive, however, until they find the perfect conditions. Inactive b. anthracis stays in soil and can last for decades if not a century. Then, the infected hide must be handled in such a way that the spores survive. For example, these spores do not thrive well in the cold nor in extreme heat like boiling water . If the spores manage to survive the conditions, then there are other conditions that must still occur.  Because the spores are electro statically charged, they tend to not move very easily. Tens of thousands donât just fly off the hide and into your nose by a simple rustling of it. Of course, very vigorous movements with a contaminated hide, in a highly confined area, with no ventilationâ¦.not good. Spores also donât cluster so easily, and so each one would fly its own path.  Got it  They are inactive until given oxygen off a host in the right conditions, and donât move in the air easily. Another condition that must then exist seems to be the size that can get in. Endospores a term referring to the type size of spores that can travel and get through to infect someone are 1 micrometer by 1.5 micrometer in size. Endospores are then phagocytosed by macrophages and carried to regional lymph nodes. Spores then germinate inside macrophages and become vegetative cells, which leave the macrophages and multiply in the lymphatic system. In other wordsâ¦they must successfully go through a transformation and go on the move. Lastly, youâd have to breath A LOT of spores of this size in! Because they donât like to move around, and usually travel individually, youâd have to work in a confined, unventilated space to start. A contributing factor could also be having a highly charged room, such as gloss paint on every wall so that they fly in many directions once spurred by using a razor to cut hide or remove hair, i.e. . Your nose is not magnetic, so itâs not inclined to draw in spores, so youâd have to be working with your face very close to it. AND, it still takes several thousand spores. Lastly, reports even say that itâs still hard to get an infectious dose and therefore being worn down, having a chest cold or pneumonia might also be contributory.  Spore counts  Letâs put it this way: a lethal dose of bio terror grade anthrax which is super charged and super concentrated is reported to result from inhalation of 10,000 20,000 spores usually by an aerosol propelled means. 2,500 can infect, but not be deadly at all. Moreover, in 2001 in the U.S. mail Anthrax cases, some were contaminated with 100 billion to 1 trillion anthrax spores per gram. Of the 11 who got those weapons grade anthrax letters, five died.  But, as we now know well, it can happen as a very rare occurrence. So, letâs keep reading. More about the spores:  In most cases the spores are easily killed by sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet light. Take every precaution you can.  Many aerial spores can be trapped by a simple HEPA or P100 filter. Inhalation of anthrax spores can be prevented with a full face mask using appropriate filtration. Unbroken skin can be decontaminated by washing with simple soap and water. One man from Australia also uses a Hepa filter in the room and places a strong magnet six feet away from his work area. He then boils the magnet for 30 minutes after each shaving and uses straight bleach to clean the filter. Again, catching âmanyâ spores is not catching enough. Better to know where who you buy from. Using a filter, mask and gloves is a good idea in any case.  Killing all spores is another story. The U.S. Navy Manual on Operational Medicine and Fleet Support, entitled Biological Warfare Defense Information Sheet states \"Disinfection of contaminated articles may be accomplished using a 0.05% hypochlorite solution 1 tbsp. bleach per gallon of water . Spore destruction however requires steam sterilization.\" Anthrax spores are killed by boiling 100C or 212F for 30 minutes the actual reported time is considerably less . If boiling as a means of disinfection, the spores must be in liquid suspension to ensure killing and in a sealed container to avoid aerosolization or vaporization of droplet nuclei containing spores .  Other notes facts related to the true level of the likelihood and danger:  More than 95% of all cases of b. anthracis are cutaneous.  In inhalational b. anthracis, the spores are ingested by alveolar macrophages, which transport them to the regional tracheobronchial lymph nodes, where germination occurs. What does this mean  Even after you inhale it, they have to be transported in order to become active. They change nature in doing this âmove,â and this is why we cannot get it from an infected personâs breath. The actual spore has been definitively changed during the ingestion and germination.  The largest reported epidemic of b. anthracis anthrax occurred in Zimbabwe from 1978 through 1980, with an estimated 10,000 cases. Essentially all were cutaneous, with very rare cases of gastrointestinal disease and eight cases of inhalational anthrax. Very, very few died and rapid diagnosis was hampered.  There have been a few incidences documented worldwide including the U.S. and so itâs not unique to any area or country or people. You can see this for yourself just by doing a web search. Direct facts related to drum makers and our community:  â¢ Hide and fur exporters and importers in most countries are REQUIRED to prove the animal was inoculated while it was alive. This is not always fail safe.  Because sporulation of b. anthracis requires oxygen and therefore does not occur inside a closed carcass, regulations in most countries forbid postmortem examination of animals when anthrax is suspected. In other words, we cannot tell if a carcassâ hide is clean or not, once itâs deceased. I will do my best to find out more about this, and send an update if I find out anything .  Because it takes a lot of spores to get infected, and in all those conditions above, once even infected skins are processed soaked and shaved , there is a  0 % chance of getting infected. This is why ready made drums, and tanned hides, or processed wool, or bone jewelry, cannot infect someone. You cannot become infected by playing drums. b. anthracis, and so, NO, dance studios and drum markets are not unsafe!  Yes, a bit of hair is left around the rim of a drum sometimes. NO, you cannot contract the bacteria from this processed hide while playing or handling drums.  In order to get infected, we repeat, it takes a lot of spores. Any location that has a few or âsomeâ spores is not considered hazardous. This includes having been near Vado, in his house or van, etc. We hope this is clear!  Cutaneous b. anthracis requires less and not as specific spores. Always wear gloves and protective gear as a safety precaution when working with hides, no matter how remote the chance. see the precautionary measures for people who work with raw hides outlined at the top Final Notes:  Of interest to our community might be the following sites I ran across. I donât know the source of their information, but I thought Iâd pass it on. Use your own judgement! This person addresses strengthening your immune system, and in a way relates it to b. anthracis Anthrax   Also, check out a drummerâs web site, R. Clark, regarding drummers, handcare, and even a note on anthrax   Regarding myself, the writer of this, Krista C. Retto: Iâm not a doctor, nor a scientist. For those of you who donât know me, I am a West African dancer in the community for 17 years, and a very close friend of Vado and Lisa Diomande. Once I found out Vado was sick, being a nursesâ daughter, and out of intense concern and love, I gathered my facts from a zillion sources. I had most but not all of them checked by the NY Dept. of Health. Janine and Alex, Lisaâs sister inlaw and her brother also provided some of the web research. For government info: .  Urgent medical questions in the New York area should be directed to the New York Dept of Health 212 788 3000.  References Both utilized and cited by other references cited. Some are very scientific, some to from the medical community, some by lay persons or interviewsâ¦ It is scary if you just dive in without being able to put it all into context. And, please, if youâre going to go into the references, realize I did not put them in any order and certainly am not able to cross check their accuracy.

    "fileDetails": " BEMBEYA JAZZ  Bembeya Jazz, originally formed in Beyla, Guinea, have had a central role in the musical culture of Guinea for the past 35 years. The orchestra, varying between 15 and 25 members, features electric guitars, horns, percussion, and vocals. Their sound is an unusual blend of traditional Guinean music with Congo and Islamic influences along with the Cuban rumba sound that infused so many African recordings beginning in the late 1950s. Originally founded by Aboubacar Demba Camara in 1961, Bembeya Jazz became the official Guinean National Orchestra in 1966. After Aboubacar's untimely death in a car crash in 1973 the orchestra fell apart without his leadership and creative direction. During the later '60s and continuing into the '70s Bembeya toured widely in Africa, occasional visiting Moscow and and even Cuba. In '85 Bembeya toured Europe and record several albums, including Telegramme, Montagne, Bembeya Jazz National, and Yekeke. Back to "

Bubblegum borrows from township jive with vocals arranged as overlapping call and response patterns, but diverges by often using multiple synthesizers to reproduce most sounds, along with the electronic drum box. Forget saxophones or drumming or even the syncopated guitar riffs popular in mbanqanga. Chaka Chaka's powerful alto voice along with her finely crafted and arranged material accounts for her wide popularity. Back to  Copyright Â© 1995 1998 Janet Planet "

Boukman's sound merged dance music with Haiti's religious preoccupation with Vodou one of the many forms the Yoruban religion took after the Diaspora . Their music is heavily identified in Haiti with the springtime festival called Rara. In fact, Boukman first rose to popular interest after they began winning Best Song at Carnival. In the aftermath of the the September 1991 army coup against the Aristede government, Boukman struggled against censorship culminating in having their 1992 Carnival entry, Kalfou Danjere, banned by the military authorities as \"too violent\". They were excluded from Carnival celebrations and their songs were prohibited from being aired on the radio. Boukman take their name from a Vodou priest who helped to unify the Haitian slaves. The slave leader led the revolution against the French colonists which ended in 1804 with the former slaves victoriously forming the first Black republic in the world. Boukman Eksperyans spread their Vodou unifying spiritual message throughout the world with their artful blend of traditional Haitian rhythms with rock, reggae, and Caribbean sounds. The past few years Boukman Eksperyans have appeared on the popular Africa Fete tour, which, in 1996, also included Oumou Sangare, Femi Kuti, and Baba Maal. Back to "

Bonga split his time between Paris where there was a very active African music community and Lisbon where he could easily communicate since he spoke Portuguese . It was in Europe that he became exposed to musicians from other Portuguese speaking countries, like Brazil, and picked up the sound of the samba. After independence, in 1979, the newly formed government began a government supported orchestra called Semba Tropical, a showcase band for Angola's top solo acts, with the purpose of reviving the music industry. As a ministry spokesman said during the band's tour of Europe during the mid 1980s:  \"We had great problems because of the was for independence. When the Portuguese left they dismantled some of the basic structure by snmashing and sabotaging equipment and we had to start from scratch. After independence there were no bands at all.

In the early 1970s Clegg teamed up with Sipho Mchunu and as Juluka they made history as they bucked the strict apartheid government by becoming the first mixed race band to play together on stage. Juluka's sound melded the predominant Zulu sound with the Celtic callings from Clegg's origins. Their song \"Scatterling of Africa\" was released as a single and had some worldwide limited success. After repeated concert shutdowns, and threats because the band angered the then apartheid government, Mchunu retreated to his farm in 1986 and Clegg went on to form a more westernized pop sound with the group Savuka. In the mid 1990s Clegg and Juluka reformed, with original member Sipho Mchunu, and they toured the world on a bill with . Also try this page about  Back to  Copyright Â© 1995 2000 Janet Planet "

This association prompted her to begin composing and singing and she soon began appearing on occasional broadcasts on Radio Rwanda. Later on, in her official capacity as a welfare officer, she began to be exposed to people in the many different regions of Rwanda. This experience, coupled with her formative years, led to her lifelong interest in her traditional Rwandan culture. In 1983 Kayirebwa traveled to Terveuren, Belgium where she studied traditional music at the Royal Museum of Central Africa. One year later she joined the Belgium based African band, Bula Sangoma, with whom she continues to record with today. Back to  Copyright Â© 1995 1998 Janet Planet "

Diallo won a scholarship from his government and he began his advanced studies in 1967 at the University of Montreal in Canada. He graduated with a B.S. degree in chemistry, working for just a few years in that field. The call of the drum beat too loudly in his soul and after a while Diallo felt increasingly alienated from his laboratory career.

Thus I have felt pushed toward others as I made my own path\" In the spring of 1949, when Manu was just 15, his parents sent him to Paris to prepare for a professional career. After twenty one seasick days he reached Marseilles. He waited for hours until his sponsor showed up and they boarded a crowded train for Paris where he was enrolled in a technical school at Saint Calais where he finshed his second and third years of high school. Before he came to Saint Calais the locals there had never seen a black person, thus he became an object of curiosity. Soon Manu met , another African expatriate, and together the two began to explore the jazz scene in Calais. They started a band before they really knew how to play the instruments and learned as they went along. Bebey explained twelve bar blues to Manu and finally he began to understand the music of a favorite artist, Duke Ellington. Manu studied classical piano before taking up the saxophone around 1954. Two years later he moved to Brussels and played sax and vibes with various jazz bands. Once in Brussels Manu began to take off as a musician. He met Coco and within a year they decided to stay together, Manu still regards her as his \"eternal guardian angel.\"  Back to  Copyright Â© 1995 1998 Janet Planet "

Born in the late 1940s, Chiweshe grew up in Zimbabwe's forest region of Mhondoro, about 45 miles from the capital city, Harare. Chiwese began learning to play the mbira dza vadzimu in 1964. It was very unusual for a girl to play mbira at that time and Chiweshe had to face the dissaproval of her community, where woman performers were often treated as \"loose women.\" Chiweshe perservered to become perhaps the best known player of the instrument outside Zimbabwe. The mbira dza vadzimu is a sacred instrument used by the Shona people of Zimbabwe to call on the spirit of their ancestors in ceremonies called \"bira.\" In these traditional cermonies the repetitive, chiming melodies and rhythms of the mbira combine with the hosho gourd rattles , singing, and sometimes drumming on the ngoma , to inspire the ancestors to offer advice and guidance through a spirit medium. In 1974, Chiwese recorded her first single \"Kasahwa,\" useing a borrowed mbira, The song was a hit and she went on to record 24 singles over the next six years. She joined the National Dance Company in 1981 and began to travel to other countried to perform. These days Chiwese maintains a home in both Zimbabwe and Germany and tours extensively throughout Europe and the Eastern United States.

At the age of 6 Diblo moved to Kinshasa and by the age of 15 he was playing guitar in the great Franco's TPOK band. In Kinshasa, Diblo continued to master his lava hot guitar chops with such top Zairean bands as Vox Africa, Orchestre Bella Mambo, and Bella Bella. In 1979 Diblo left Zaire and landed in Brussels where he played a rented guitar and washed dishes to make money. In 1981 he moved to Paris, where the Soukous scene was a happening thing. He rejoined , who he had played with in Bella Bella. Their first album, Iyole 1981 , was a big hit: Kanda became a big star, and Diblo became the most sought after session man in Paris. Diblo's huge European success with Kanda Bongo Man led to the formation of his own band, Loketo which means 'hips', as in 'shake your...' , featuring the work of the gifted vocalist Aurlus Mabele. By this time Diblo was the dominant Soukous session man in Paris and he was in great demand. On recordings by such Soukous giants as Kanda Bongo Man and Pepe Kalle you can hear them calling out \"Diblo\" when guitar solo time comes around. Diblo's naturally gentle demeanor might have served him well in a recording studio, but he had problems keeping Loketo together with the flamboyant Mabele. In 1990 Diblo left Loketo to form Matchatcha means \"a type of flower that produces an itch\" with a few other Loketo members, Freddy de Majunga on rhythm guitar, Miguel Yamba on bass, and dancers Antoinette Yelessa and Joelle Esso. Diblo also added session drummer Komba Bello Mafwala, and vocalists Fede Lawu and Otis Mbute. Continuing to have problems with keeping his bands together, Matchatcha went through another change of personnel in 1992 when de Majunga and Lawu left to be replaced by Frenchman J.P. Kinzaki on rhythm guitar, and two vocalists, Dely Mpeletu and David Mondo. Later on in '92 Yamba left the band to be replaced by his his protege Fellyko, and in '94 he was replaced by Djo Mali. Congo player Serge Bimangou was also added around this time. Though Diblo has certainly gottten better at keeping his band together, Matchatcha is still undergoing personnel changes. To see Diblo and Matchatcha in concert is to experience a hot hot time. His scoarching guitar leads will leave you breathless and when you're hand is grabbed and you're swept up onstage to dance with the band you'll close your eyes and suddenly be transported to Kinshasa.

    "fileDetails": " FELA ANIKULAPO KUTI  Fela Anikulapo Kuti, born in Abeokuta, Nigeria in 1938, was a singer composer, trumpet, sax and keyboard player, bandleader, and politician. Kuti was one of Africa's most controversial musicians and throughout his life he continued to fight for the rights of the common man and woman despite vilification, harassment, and even imprisonment by the government of Nigeria. Born to Yoruban parents, Kuti was strongly influenced by both parents, his mother being Funmilayo, a leading figure in the nationalist struggle. Practically all of his records are dominated by political events and discussions from the approach of Pan Africanism. In 1954, Kuti joined the Cool Cats as a singer in that highlife band highlife being the rage of the Lagos music scene at the time . During this period Kuti developed his own unusual sound which he described as highlife jazz. In 1968 Kuti announced the arrival of Afro beat, within the year was promoting his sound all over the USA on a 10 month tour where he became influenced by American jazz. When he returned to his homeland he opened a nightclub, the Shrine, and changed the name of his band to Africa 70 and later to Egypt 80 . His bands traditionally included the typical huge line up consisting of many singers and dancers, numerous saxophonists, trumpeteers, drummers, percussionists, and of course, many guitarists blending African rhythms and jazz horn lines with politicized song lyrics. His music was intricate, rather than calling it Afro beat you might more arguably consider it Afro jazz. Entire recordings often consisted of just a few songs and this propensity for jamming set up a roadblock for Fela to attain commercial acceptance in the United States. He also abhored performing a song after recording it, and this led to audience disinterest in the U.S. where the people wanted their music to be recognizable hits. Kuti continued his outspoken attacks on the Nigerian government. When the people returned to power in 1979, Kuti began his own political party   MOP Movement of the People . The military returned to power in 1983 and within the year Kuti was sentenced to five years in prison on a spurious currency smuggling charge. He was released in 1986 after yet another change of government. Fela Anikulapo Kuti died on Saturday, August 2, 1997, at 4pm local time in Lagos, Nigeria. It had been rumoured for some time that Fela had a serious illness he was refusing treatment for, many said he was suffering from prostate cancer. But as it turns out, Fela died from complications due to AIDS. As Fela's brother, Olikoye Ransome Kuti, said at a news conference:  \"The immediate cause of death of Fela was heart failure, but there were many complications arising from the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome\".

Originally discovered by William Burroughs and Paul Bowles in the '50s, they were brought to the world's attention in 1967 by Brian Jones yup, the original Rolling Stones guitarist , he went there on a retreat, stumbled across them and flipped out. Jones drowned a month after returning from Morocco and the album he recorded, Brian Jones Presents The Pipes of Pan at Jajouka, was released two years later, in 1969. It was recently re released on CD in early '95 by Point Music. The Berber Master Musicians of Jajouka eventually wound up on a album. Mick Jagger called them  \"One of the most musically inspiring groups still left on the plant.\" Their music is a strange at least to Western ears combination of high pitched, nasal buzzing sounds imagine a swarm of bees with surging waves of rhythm which can induce an ecstatic trance state. In performance on their first U.S. tour in 1997 they reinacted the week long lunar feast of Aid el Kebir in which their music creates a trance like atmosphere that engulfs the whole village. Also check out Bachir Attir, he was one of the more successful members who went on to establish his own solo career he just released an album in '95 . Try their recording Apocalypse Across the Sky.

Long known as the queen of the morna, a soulful genre sung in Creole Portuguese, she mixes her sentimental folk tunes filled with longing and sadness with the acoustic sounds of guitar, cavaquinho, violin, accordian, and clarinet. Evora's Cape Verdean blues often speak of the country's long and bitter history of isolation and slave trade, as well as emigration: almost two thirds of the million Cape Verdeans alive live abroad.  \"Morna is like the blues because it is a way to express life's suffering in music.\" Evora's voice, a finely tuned, melancholy instrument with a touch of hoarseness, highlights her emotional phrasing by accenting a word or phrase. Even audiences who do not understand her language are held spell bound by the emotions evident in her performances. Now 54, and a grandmother though never married , Evora is gladdened by her current worldwide popularity,  \"... in all those years when I sang in bars and in front of strangers I sometimes   had an idea I might someday be successful outside my country. The thought never stayed with   me for very long, but here I am.\" CESARIA DISCOGRAPHY: La Diva aux Pieds Nus Lusafrica Melodie, France Mar Azul Lusafrica Melodie, France Distino di Belita Miss Perfumado Lusafrica Melodie, France Cesaria Lusafrica 1995 Saudades best of 1995  Back to  Copyright Â© 1995 1998 Janet Planet "

Former slaves originally from the Sudan who travelled to Morocco and converted to Islam, the Gnawa people of Morocco serve as intermediaries in the spirit world and also as entertainers. Hassan was raised in Marrakech and began to study the healing rituals of tagnawit, the Gnawa related arts and lore, at a young age. His travels led him to Europe and the U.S. and eventually to participate in several WOMAD tours, recordings with his fusion group Zahar and work with Peter Gabriel. The Fire Within is Hassan's first traditional based musical project, featuring the sintir, a three stringed bass lute. Clear, balanced melodies and driving, syncopated rhythms make the music appealing to Western listeners. Several of the songs on this recording are taken from different parts of the derdeba, a trance ritual held to placate spirits that inhabit people or places. Deeply entrancing, The Fire Within hit the European world music charts within a week of it's release. MOTW135 CD only  Back to  Copyright Â© 1995 1998 Janet Planet "

Papa Ladji Camara was born June 15, 1923, in Norassoba, Guinea, West Africa. Papa's fate was revealed to his parents by his maternal grandfather before he ever entered this world. His grandfather said that through the great sacrifices his family will have to endure, this third child would become one of the greatest drummers this world would ever know. His gift will take him from his native Guinea to Mali, Senegal, Europe, and America and in fact, throughout the world. In 1939 at the tender age of 16, under the direction of Keita Fodeba, Ladji Camara performed with Les Ballets Africans in Paris Keita Fodeba started this multicultural company, consisting of members from France, Haiti and Martinique . After touring with this Company for 7 years and recording an album, Papa returned to Senegal. In 1953, Les Ballets Africans de Keita Fodeba arrived to tour in Dakar and Papa Ladji was recommended to join them. With this company, Ladji had the opportunity to once again come to the United States. At a gathering one evening after a successful performance, Ladji discovered the lack of knowledge of African culture amongst the many guests. At that moment, Papa Ladji Camara's destiny for the United States became clear. In 1958, Papa appeared in a film with Les Ballets Africans in Rome, Italy. Papa Ladji toured with the National Ballet de Republic of Guinea  formally Lest Ballets African de Keita Fodeba the name changed after the Independence of Guinea in 1958 in May of 1960, which gain took him to the United States, Canada and Europe.

After performing, Papa Ladji would meet Chief Bey at the \"African Room\" at 44th Street and 7th Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. Papa would perform with Chief Bey until at least 4 or 5 in the morning. Papa told Chief Bey that one day his daughter Denise Chief Bey's daughter will dance in his company. When Papa Ladji stated his dance company in the Bronx, Denise Bey was one of his first students. Denise Bey was also helpful with the introduction of African hairdress with Papa's wife. In 1959, Papa Ladji met Charles Moore. Before the Independence of Guinea, Charles went to the Embassy of Guinea to request a visa to visit the country to study the African dance. He was denied. Upon meeting Ladji again in 1962, Charles Moore and Ladji performed in schools, libraries and museums in New York and New Jersey. Upon returning to the United States, Ladji was invited to perform with the Bamboise Dance Company in Hollywood, California with Katherine Dunham. This multi racial company consisting of members from the U.S., Morocco and Africa was part of Ladji's dream of the unification of cultures. From 1963 to 1971, Papa performed with the legendary Baba Olatunji. In addition, Ladji worked with Pearl Primus and the Constance Santi Dance Company Haitian Company . Between 1965 and 1966 Papa performed with the legendary Jazz master Yusef Lateef. In 1966 Papa performed and taught Master class dance and drumming at Nan Dinzulu. He continued to work with Dinzulu until 1990. In 1969, Papa performed with the Nilo Tandra Dance Company at the Hotel Liboria on 47th Street in New York. Mongo Santamaria was amongst the many musicians that performed with Ladji. In 1971, Papa opened his African drumming and dance studio, the Ladji Camara African Dance Studio, located in the Bronx, NY. His spouse, the late Aminata Camara, introduced African hair braiding and hair design, food and attire to the community. This studio was created as an opportunity for everyone to experience the African culture. The Ladji Camara Dance Company performed at the Kennedy Center in Boston in March 1971. Papa also performed with Nina Simone in 1972, Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers in 1973 and Alvin Ailey in 1974. The dream of Ladji's grandfather was coming full circle.

He established the musical style, chimurenga the Shona word for struggle . In the 1970s Zimbabwe's people fought a war of independence againt their white Rhodesian rulers. Out of that grew chimurenga which is based on the Shona majority's chiming, cyclical rhythms, patterns and melodies of the mbira resulting in a hypnotric almost trance like music. Mapfumo took that traditional music and added electric guitars, horns, and a drum kit. With his electronic interpretations of traditional mbira music he became a huge star in Zimbabwe. Being that some of his lyrics addressed the struggle for independence the white Rhodesian government felt threatened by his popularity, As a result, in 1977, Mapfumo was detained in prison for 90 days because of his song Hokoya Watch Out .

    "fileDetails": " HUGH MASEKELA  Hugh Masekela, born near Johannesburg in 1939, has covered the globe and played with just about every top star you can think of. Masekela was originally introduced to the trumpet by anti apartheid activist Father Trevor Huddleston. The anti apartheid movement became an important influence in his life, but not as important as the music that ended up taking him around the world many times. In his early days in the South African music scene Masekela played with such names as pianist now known as Abdullah Ibrahim , Jonas Gwangwa, and Kippie Moeketsi as teenageers in the Father Huddleston Band. In 1961 Masekela went into exile where Harry Belafonte helped him settle in the U.S. as a student. Hugh landed in New York where he recorded many records including his 1968 number one hit \"Grazing in the Grass.\" Masekela also played with such luminaries as , Zimbabwean , the Jazz Epistles, , Hedzoleh Soundz, Francis Fuster, , and was instrumental in the South African Broadway style musical King Kong with many of the same people. Masekela went on to performd with Paul Simon on the Graceland tour and defended Simon vigorously when the tour was seen as a violation of the ANC's cultural boycott. His 1987 hit \"Bring Him Back Home\" became the anthem for Nelson Mandela's world tour following his release from prison in 1992. Masekela once again lives in South Africa and still tours throughout the world extensively. Back to  Copyright Â© 1995 1998 Janet Planet "

    "fileDetails": " SAMBA MAPANGALA  by Douglas B. Paterson 1  Zairean vocalist and band leader Samba Mapangala has been a dominant figure in East African music since the mid 1970s. Arriving in Kampala, Uganda with his group, Les Kinois in 1975, they eventually made their way to Nairobi in 1977. The beginnings of the famous Virunga sound were already evident in their recordings prior to the breakup of Les Kinois in 1980. Shortly after that, Samba recorded the now famous Malako recordings in Nairobi with his newly formed Orchestra Virunga. The Malako LP was one of the pioneering releases of the newly emerging world music scene in Europe in the mid 1980s and an instant favorite. The style was typical of other East African groups of the time: a lean sound with complex, interlocking guitar lines; rapid fire bass; light, fast paced percussion; with horn or sax overlays. What was different about Samba and Virunga was the quality of the product. The songs began with Samba's catchy melodic lines and evolved over a nine or ten minute period through beautiful vocal harmonies and brilliant guitar and horn soloing. Samba's voice, even today, is unique among African vocalists for its pleasing quality and versatility. Virunga's East African roots are, no doubt, one of the primary factors that set them apart from other Zairean bands. At the same time, it is perhaps because of their East African base that they haven't really had a chance to develop on the world music scene. The band has been hampered by work permit problems, Nairobi's deteriorating but expensive recording facilities, and Kenya's shrinking live music market that makes it difficult to keep a large band together. Sadly, in 1993, Samba gave up on the local night club scene and disbanded the group. Virunga as a concept continues, however, with Samba preparing a new release in Paris in April, 1995 under the auspices of Senegalese producer Ibrahim Sylla. For the new recording, titled Karibu Kenya, the \"new\" Virunga back up band comprises some of the top names in Parisian soukous: , Pablo Lubadika, Komba Bellow, Wuta Mayi, Bibi Den's Tshibayi, and Syran Mbenza. Samba will form his touring bands from among both Parisian and East African musicians.

At twenty he'd scraped up enough money to buy a used Fender Stratocaster. Mbaye was just as determined to get a guitar as he was to make it in the competitive Dakar music scene. Early on he met Youssou N'Dour and together they became rising stars on Senegal's club scene, playing mbalax music. They created the \"Super Etoile\" band together in 1979 and have been musically inseparable for all these years. Mbaye recorded six top selling major label albums with N'Dour before taking a leave of absence to record his own solo album, released in 1997, Dakar Heart. Recorded at N'Dour's Studio Xippi, Dakar Heartfeatures N'Dour's band \"Super Etoile\". Mbaye is back at N'Dour's side and is very much an integral part of Youssou's \"Super Etoile\" band these days. In fact, Youssou often travels abroad only with Jimi as acoustic guitar accompanist, as he did in June 1998 for performances in Paris as guests of Brazilian performer Gilberto Gil at the Olympia Theatre.

Soon they had a hit juju single \"Ewa Wowun Ojumi Ri.\" Though juju had been around for a while it was still highly influenced by Ghanaian highlife. Obey modernized the sound by adding the funkiness of Yoruban drumming, more Western style guitars and drum kits, and added multiple talking drums, where only one had been used before. That was the beginning of modern juju. As he says:  \"It's like cooking a soup. If you put in many different ingredients, it tastes richer and better\" In 1966, Obey's chief juju rival, came on the scene, and they still maintain a friendly rivalry today.

Babatunde Olatunji On April 6, 2003, only one day before his 76th birthday, one of the most important figures in popular music of the later half of the 20th century passed away surrounded physically by family and friends   and surrounded spiritually by the love and prayers of thousands of people around the world who also counted him among their family. Babatunde Olatunji died Sunday morning, April 6, 2003 just ten days after being admitted to Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital, of complications due to his long struggle with the effects of Diabetes. Olatunji had a profound impact on everyone who knew him and everyone who had been touched by his love for the drum and the African culture that nurtured that love. Babatunde Olatunji was born 1927 in the small village of Ajido, about forty miles from , the capital of the country. This small fishing and trading town amplified the ebb and flow of the seasons through the sounds of drumming that echoed through the nights. As a child, Olatunji accompanied his great aunt Tanyin to hear the drums   hollowed out from trees and covered with the skin of goats   punctuate the lives of his people. The drummers celebrated every occasion, proclaimed the coming of local politicians, evoked the dreams and aspirations of their people. The drumbeat of his childhood became the life blood of his adult experience as Olatunji grew and traveled throughout the world popularizing the music of his Yoruban heritage. While still in Africa in the late '40s, the ever resourceful Olatunji read in about the scholarships offered to youths from war affected countries. By 1950, Olatunji and his cousin were each awarded a scholarship and were on their way to America to attend school in . Olatunji came to the U.S. determined to succeed in the international arena, at the time he had no aspirations to be a musician. In 1954, after graduating from with a degree in Diplomacy, Olatunji moved to to begin a Political Science postgraduate program in Public Administration at . Throughout his American education he had a unique perspective on the cultural divides between black and white Americans. Early on he realized that music, drumming in particular, had the ability to break down the long established cultural divisions within the \"\" that America was thought to be in those days. These sorts of insights were the motivating factor that brought Olatunji to begin performing the drumming of his Yoruba ancestors. To cover his expenses he started a small drumming and dance group. Recognizing the influence of African polyrhythms in jazz, some of Olatunji's earliest fans were the jazz greats of the time; men like , , , , , , , , , Bill Lee Spike Lee's father , and Dance luminary ; not to mention the legendary noted A&R man who produced Olatunji's first album. Even , also a Moorehouse graduate invited Olatunji to tour with him. In 1957 when producer John Hammond heard Olatunji performing at with a 66 piece orchestra, he was so impressed that this fortuitous meeting led directly to the recording of . Released in 1959 by Columbia Records, Olatunji's first album became an unprecedented, worldwide smash hit. It was the first album to bring genuine African music to Western ears, and it went on to sell over five million copies and is still a popular recording. In 1964 Olatunji performed at the African Pavilion at the where he was able to raise enough money to open the Olatunji Center for African Culture OCAC in , offering classes in African dance, music, language, folklore, and history. During this period Baba's students included people like , , , Yao Tamakloe,   musicians who both performed with him in his band and who today continue on to spread Baba's love for the drum all over the world. The help to fund Olatuni's OCAC teacher and student training programs which went to all over the schools in the New York tri state area, all the way to Long Island. first encountered Olatunji in one of those educational African programs. In his classes Baba always asked the students to come and beat on the drums and he first recognized Mickey's talent over 25 years ago in one of those programs. Olatunji's impact on the drumming culture around the world is unprecedented. He has been a member of the faculties at the in , California and the in Rhinebeck, New York for over 15 years. He played with , the , , and on his 1986 recording Drums of Passion: The Beat.  \"Rhythm is the soul of life.  The whole universe revolves in rhythm.  Everything and every human action revolves in rhythm.\"    Babatunde Olatunji Both in concert and in the studio, Olatunji opted for a big sound, often using 20 or more singers, percussionists, and dancers. His two releases produced by Mickey Hart   Drums of Passion: The Beat 1989 and Drums of Passion: The Invocation 1988   show both his willingness to experiment and find common ground with American musicians, and his devotion to ancient African traditions. In 1991 he and Hart joined forces on , a group that toured around the country and later recorded an album that won a Grammy Award. His composition \"Jingo Lo Ba\" has become a timeless anthem and a signature song for the rock group Santana. He has written scores for Broadway and Hollywood productions, including the music for She's Gotta Have It, a film by . In 1997, released Love Drum Talk, which went on to be nominated for the 1998 Grammy for Best World Music Album. Baba was the single most important contributor to the popularization of African hand drumming in the United States. Baba created the popular method of learning drum patterns in which these spoken sounds were able to help recall the sounds made on most hand drums   with the Gun Dun denoting the bass notes played with right and left hands; the Go Do denoting the open tones; and the Pa Ta denoting the slaps. This simple method revolutionized the learning rate for thousands of hand drum students in the West. He is also well known for popularizing the popular Liberian rhythm a song of welcome to which he added words , which was often played for him by his students when he would enter a workshop. For the few years before his death Olatunji made his home at along the wild coastline in , where he continued to teach while battling the ravages of Diabetes. Olatunji traveled throughout the world for almost half a century giving percussion workshops spreading his love of the drum, song, music, and African culture inspiring generations of American musicians, many of whom have devoted their careers to African music and who are, in turn, spreading Baba's message to their students.  \"The spirit of the drum is something that you feel but cannot put your hands on,  It does something to you from the inside out . . .  It hits people in so many different ways.  But the feeling is one that is satisfying and joyful.  It is a feeling that makes you say to yourself, '  I'm glad to be alive today!

A griot from both sides of his family, he learned his art from his father, DjÃ©li Sori DiabatÃ©. Breaking with tradition, his father also taught Prince's mother, Hadja DjÃ©li Sira Cissoko, to play kora. The young boy became an exceptionally early starter by accompanying his parents to their concerts throughout West Africa. Despite his father's disapproval, he decided to make music his life. In 1981, he won his first international contest in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and acquired his nickname, 'Prince DiabatÃ©, Prince of the Kora.' In 1986 he met the singer, Amara Sanoh, and the two started to perform together. They disbanded in 1998. A world class musician, Prince DiabatÃ© has toured in Africa, Europe, Canada and the US, developing a unique style, characterized by a dazzlingly fast technique and a dynamic stage presence. He has recorded two CDs: 'Lamaranaa' in 1993, which was awarded a 4 star rating, and 'Ko Allah Wallata' in 1998; his third CD, 'New Life,' is due for release on Sunrise Records in 2001. Although his main sources of inspiration stem from the traditional Mandingo or MalinkÃ© repertoire, he borrows happily from reggae, rap, blues and funk, and is often referred to as the \"Jimi Hendrix\" of the kora. He sings in MalinkÃ©, Susu, Peulh, Wolof, French and English, but rejects classification and embraces innovation. Prince DiabatÃ© brings not only a unique mastery over his ancestral tradition, but a commitment to renew it with fresh ideas and exchanges with musicians from other cultures. Currently resident in Los Angeles, he performs with his acoustic trio, his fusion band, as well as solo and with his traditional Guinean band. In addition, he has created a totally new sound, 'Mandingo Reggae' which is featured on 'New Life.' Prince's website:  Back to  Copyright Â© 1995 2001 Janet Planet "

The Bloco Afro, Olodum, was founded in 1979; five years later it turned itself into a grupo cultural when a black woman for the first time in Salvador's history became it's President. This ushered in a new era of Africanism in Salvador that broke with the colonial idea of 'negritude', which, of course, stemmed from the slave era. Olodum consists of hundreds of players of varying ages and levels of skill, with the older, more experienced musicians constantly teaching young children the dances and rhythms of their heritage. Their music pays testimony to the recognition of traditional African music in their use of the many different percussion instruments, the rhythms, dances, costumes, decorations body and otherwise , as well as the use of liturgical choral songs. Olodum finance their progress by producing instruments and costumes, not to mention T shirts and CD's, that they sell throughout the world. In 1988 Paul Simon recorded Olodum for his Rhythm of the Saints album. The group did not receive any money for their work because their President saw it as a cultural exchange. In the long run that was probably a wise idea, because it certainly exposed Olodum to the world and as a result they now tour widely as back up instrumentalists or open for big acts. When Simon later made a video for Obvious Child the musicians and performers did received a fee, and they were paid royalties as well. During the Bahia Carnival Olodum, along with such other afoxe blocos as Ara Ketu, Timbalada, Geronimo, and Filhos de Ghandi, parade in amazing costumes through the streets of Salvador on wild mobile floats, their music shouting out though the streets via loudspeakers.

The general idea was that weary travelers would tumble into the Buffet Bar where the Rail Band would perform real Manding music. Singing in Bambara, a Manding language spoken not only in Mali, but also in Guinea, the Gambia, and parts of Senegal, the band adopted traditional kora and balafon songs and rhythms mixing in an Islamic influenced vocal style to what was becoming modern urban pop music.  began singing lead for the Rail Band at it's inception, when he was only twenty one. Instruments and equipment were government owned and band members were considered government employees. The Rail Band quickly became a sort of rite of passage for Malian musical talent. As mentioned, Salif Keita got his start with them, as did guitarist Kante Manfila who both soon left the Rail Band to start Les Ambassadeurs , and singer Mory Kante who assumed lead vocal responsibilities after Keita left . The Rail Band's music was Manding influenced, latin tinged, with with lightness and swing, and despite the modern instruments you can clearly hear the strains of the original Manding music. The idea of the original Rail Band stills survives to this day, though they now compete with disco's and video clubs and as a result they started playing only once a week.

Sangare is the leading female star of the Wassoulou sound which is based on an ancient tradition of hunting rituals mixed with songs about devotion, praise, and harvest played with pentatonic five note melodies. Wassoulou is typified by a strong Arabic feel along with the sound of the scraping karinyang, women play the fle, a calabash strung with cowrie shells, which they spin and throw into the air in time to the music. Sangare most often sings about about love and the importance of freedom of choice in marriage, an issue she feels strongly about because her father had two wives which Sangare thought was a \"catastrophe.\" In 1986, the eighteen year old Sangare toured Europe and the Caribbean with a 27 piece folkloric troupe, and at 21 she already had a huge hit in the album, Moussoulou means \"women\" which sold over 200,00 legal copies and many more in the illegal pirate cassette trade. In 1995 she toured around the world on the Africa Fete tour along with , , and Femi Kuti. Back to  Copyright Â© 1995 1998 Janet Planet "

He grew up during the formative years of highlife and his palm wine style of playing fit right into the genre. He supported himself as tailor but by the 60s he was ready to go out as a musician on his own. Singing in four languages his songs, 'Go Easy With Me', and Koneh Pehlawo' were big hits. But his biggest hit was the song 'My Lovely Elizabeth' which was covered by countless artists and is still know all along the West Coast of Africa. The song was eventually picked up by EMI and that led to a great advancement in his music and in his recordings. In 1965 Rogie formed a band, the Morningstars, who acompanied his acoustic guitar with electric intruments and the local sounds of African percussion. In 1967 he traveled to Liberia, and in 1970 he began the first of sixteen years in the U.S. performing his African Folk and Cultural Programs in Elementary and High Schools all over California. He received awards from the United States Congress and Senate, the City of Oakland, and the City of Berkeley. In 1988 he returned to his homeland. He died in 1994, just after his release of the album, Dead Men Don't Smoke Marijuana. Back to  Copyright Â© 1995 1998 Janet Planet "

He is a direct descendent of Sundiata Keita, the Mandinka warrior king who founded the Malian empire in the 13th century. Born an albino   a sign of bad luck   Keita was shunned and ostracized by his family and community alike. His poor eyesight also contributed to his personal sense of alienation. In 1967 he moved to Bamako where he began playing in nightclubs with one of his brothers. Two years later he joined the 16 member, government sponsored Rail Band that played at the Bamako railway station's Buffet Hotel de la Gare   a very choice gig at the time. In 1973 he left the Rail Band along with Kante Manfila guitarist, composer, and leader of the band to join Les Ambassadeurs. By 1977, with Keita and Les Ambassadeurs reputation extending beyond the boundaries of Mali, he was awarded the National Order of Guinea by President Ahmed Sekou Toure. In return, Keita composed Mandjou, telling the history of the Mali people and praising Sekou Toure. This hauntingly beautiful song features Keita's typical sound of guitar, organ, and sax. To see him perform it concert is an occasion you will never forget. Due to increasing political unrest, Keita left Mali in the mid '70s for Abidjan, capitol of Cote D'Ivoire the Ivory Coast , the other members of the band followed suit and they changed the name of the band to Les Ambassadeurs Internationales. By 1984 Keita had relocated to Paris in order to reach a wider, more European audience, where he joined other African stars like Mory Kante, , , Ray Lema, , and among many others. He now lives in the Montreuil section of Paris among the some 15,000 Malians there. Keita's music blends together the traditional griot music of his Malian childhood with other West African influences from Guinea, the Ivory Coast, and Senegal, along with influences from Cuba, Spain, and Portugal, and an unmistakably overall Islamic sound. Besides the aforementioned guitar, organ, and sax, Keita's sound also includes traditional African instruments such as the kora, balafon, and djembe, often synthesized and sampled.

King Sunny was influenced by the legendary Tunde Nightingale early Juju pioneer extraordinare and borrowed stylistic elements from Nightingale's 'So wa mbe' style of juju.  In 1966 he formed his own band, the Green Spots. After a long eight years in which they recorded 12 LPs for the Nigeria Africa Song label, in 1974 he entered into increasingly annoying contract hassles and a public court case. This experience prompted him into forming his own recording company linked to Decca Records. At this time he changed the name of his band to the African Beats. King Sunny Ade and The African Beats tour with the typically large African line up of 20 30 members. They play a spacey, jamming sort of Juju, characterized by tight vocal harmonies, intricate guitar work, backed by traditional talking drums, percussion instruments, and even adding the unusual pedal steel guitar and accordian.

In 1970, when the sale of his records went past a million, his musical efforts culminated in the appointment of the honorary title of Knight of Senegal. Soon after, the Republic of Chad honored him with the title Officer of the National Order. Tabu Ley's musical prowess transcended all political boundaries.

He took formally to the stage at age 12 and by his mid teens was singing regularly with the Star Band, the most successful group in Senegal at that time. In 1979, he formed his own ensemble, the Etoile de Dakar, which, by 1981, had evolved into The Super Etoile. The most famous band in Africa, The Super Etoile, guided by Youssou N'Dour has crafted and invented a thoroughly modern African pop style, one which has gone on to influence artists as diverse as and . It was Gabriel, in fact, who introduced N'Dour to American and British artists via his So album in 1986 and took N'Dour and The Super Etoile on the road with him in a subsequent world tour. In 1988, Youssou N'Dour was a co headliner on the Amnesty International \"Human Rights Now!\" tour alongside Gabriel, , , and Tracy Chapman. It was during the \"Human Rights Now!\" tour that N'Dour first heard Chimes Of Freedom and became friends with , who appears on The Guide. N'Dour's first international album releases on Virgin, The Lion 1989 , produced by George Acogny and containing the N'Dour Gabriel composed single \"Shaking The Tree\"; and Set 1990 , produced by  compadre Michael Brook, prompted Brian Cullman to write in Rolling Stone:   \"If any third world performer has a real shot at the sort of universal popularity last enjoyed by , it's Youssou, a singer with a voice so extraordinary that the history of Africa seems locked inside it.\" In the summer of 1991, Youssou N'Dour signed to Spike Lee's 40 Acres and A Mule Musicworks label, distributed by Columbia. N'Dour was impressed by Lee's stated commitment to   \"enlarging the legacy of great African American music\" in a wide range of styles and Lee's belief that N'Dour's music constituted a part of that legacy. The result of that union was 1992's Eyes Open; self produced by N'Dour at his own state of the art Xippi Studio in Dakar and featuring The Super Etoile, Eyes Open went on to win a Grammy Award nomination. Since the release of Eyes Open, Youssou N'Dour was made an ambassador for UNICEF in conjunction with the Year Of The Child. In July 1993, an African opera composed by N'Dour premiered at the Paris Opera. N'Dour was the subject of a recent episode of the BBC's Rhythms Of The World program.

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  Absolute Value Inequalities  There are many opportunities for mistakes with absolute value inequalities, so we're going to take this slowly, and look at some pictures along the way. When we're done, I hope you will have a good picture in your head of what is going on, so you won't make some of the more common errors. Once you catch on to how these inequalities work, this stuff really isn't so bad.  Let's first return to the original definition of : \"| x | is the distance of x from zero.\" For instance, since both ï¿½2 and 2 are two units from zero, we have |ï¿½2| = |2| = 2:  With this definition and picture in mind, let's look at some absolute value inequalities.  Suppose you're asked to graph the solution to | x |   3. The solution is going to be all the points that are less than three units away from zero. Look at the number line:  The number 1 will work, as will ï¿½1; the number 2 will work, as will ï¿½2. But 4 will not work, and neither will ï¿½4, because they are too far away. Even 3 and ï¿½3 won't work though they're right on the edge . But 2.99 will work, as will ï¿½2.99. In other words, all the points between ï¿½3 and 3, but not actually including ï¿½3 or 3, will work in this inequality. Then the solution looks like this:  Translating this into symbols, you find that the solution is ï¿½3   x   3.  This pattern always holds: Given the inequality | x |   a, the solution is always of the form ï¿½a   x   a. Even when the problems get more complicated, the pattern still holds.  Solve |2x + 3|   6.  Since this is a \"less than\" absolute value inequality, the first step is to clear the absolute value according to the pattern:  |2x + 3|   6 ï¿½6   2x + 3   6 this is the pattern for \"less than\" ï¿½6 ï¿½ 3   2x + 3 ï¿½ 3   6 ï¿½ 3 ï¿½9   2x   3 ï¿½9 2   x   3 2 Then the solution to |2x + 3|   6 is the interval ï¿½9 2   x   3 2.  The other case for absolute value inequalities is the \"greater than\" case. Let's first return to the number line, and consider the inequality | x |   2.  The solution will be all points that are more than two units away from zero. For instance, ï¿½3 will work, as will 3; ï¿½4 will work, as will 4. But ï¿½1 will not work, and neither will 1, because they're too close; ï¿½2 will not work, and neither will 2 although they're right on the edge . In other words, the solution will be two separate sections: one being all the points more than two units from zero off to the left, and the other being all the points more than two units from zero off to the right. The solution looks like this:  Translating this solution into symbols, you get \"x   ï¿½2 or x   2\". That is, the solution is TWO inequalities, not one. DO NOT try to write this as one inequality. If you try to write this solution as \"ï¿½2   x   2\", take out the x in the middle, and you'll see that you would be saying \"ï¿½2   2\", which certainly isn't true. Take the extra half a second, and write the solution correctly!  The pattern for \"greater than\" inequalities always holds: the solution is always in two parts. Given the inequality | x |   a, the solution always starts by splitting the inequality into two pieces: x   ï¿½a or x   a. For instance:  Solve |2x ï¿½ 3|   5.  The first thing to do is clear the absolute value bars by splitting the inequality into two:  |2x ï¿½ 3|   5 2x ï¿½ 3   ï¿½5 or 2x ï¿½ 3   5 this is the pattern for \"greater than\" 2x   ï¿½2 or 2x   8 x   ï¿½1 or x   4 This PAIR of inequalities is the solution; the solution to |2x ï¿½ 3|   5 consists of the two intervals x   ï¿½1 and x   4.  There is another situation you might encounter: You'll be given a pair of inequalities, and you'll be asked to find the corresponding absolute value inequality. This can be a bit weird, so I'll give a couple examples of how it works.  Find the absolute value inequality statement that corresponds to the inequality ï¿½2   x   4.  Take a look at the endpoints. Negative two and four are six units apart. Half of six is three. So you want to adjust the inequality so it relates to ï¿½3 and 3, instead of ï¿½2 and 4. That is, subtract 1 all around: ï¿½2   x   4 Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved ï¿½2 ï¿½ 1   x ï¿½ 1   4 ï¿½ 1 ï¿½3   x ï¿½ 1   3 Since this is the \"less than\" format, the absolute value inequality will be of the form \"absolute value of something is less than 3\". You can convert this nicely to |x ï¿½ 1|   3  Find the absolute value inequality statement that corresponds to the inequalities x   19 or x   24.  Take a look at the endpoints. Nineteen and 24 are five units apart. Half of five is 2.5. So you want to adjust the inequality so it relates to ï¿½2.5 and 2.5, instead of 19 and 24. Since 19 ï¿½ ï¿½2.5 =21.5 and 24 ï¿½ 2.5 = 21.5, you'll need to subtract 21.5 all around: x   19 or x   24 x ï¿½ 21.5   19 ï¿½ 21.5 or x ï¿½ 21.5   24 ï¿½ 21.5 x ï¿½ 21.5   ï¿½2.5 or x ï¿½ 21.5   2.5 Since this is the \"greater than\" format, the absolute value inequality will be of the form \"absolute value of something is greater than or equal to 2.5\". You can convert this nicely to |x ï¿½ 21.5|   2.5    Note: There is one \"trick\" type of question for this kind of problem, where they'll try to trip you up on homework or tests. They'll ask you to solve something like \"|x + 2|   ï¿½1\". But can an absolute value ever be negative, let alone be less than a negative? No! So there is no solution to this inequality; it doesn't even make sense. Don't waste a lot of time trying to \"solve\" this; just write down \"no solution\".

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  Absolute Value  Absolute value has many uses, but you probably won't see anything interesting for a few more classes yet. For now, you can view absolute value as the distance from zero. There is a technical for absolute value, but you probably won't see this for quite a while yet, if ever. Look at the number line: The absolute value of x, denoted \"| x |\" and which is read as \"the absolute value of x\" , is regarded as the distance of x from zero. This is why absolute value is never negative; absolute value only asks \"how far?\", not \"in which direction?\". This means that | 3 | = 3, because 3 is three units to the right of zero, and also | ï¿½3 | = 3, because ï¿½3 is three units to the left of zero.  Note: The absolute value notation is bars, not parentheses or brackets. Use the proper notation, as the other notations do not mean the same thing! It is important to note that the absolute value bars do NOT work in the same way as do parentheses. Whereas ï¿½ ï¿½3 = +3, this is NOT how it works for absolute value:  Simplify ï¿½| ï¿½3 |.  Given ï¿½| ï¿½3 |, first handle the absolute value part, taking the positive and converting the absolute value bars to parentheses: ï¿½| ï¿½3 | = ï¿½ +3 . Now you can take the negative through the parentheses: ï¿½| ï¿½3 | = ï¿½ 3 = ï¿½3  So you see that if you take the negative of an absolute value, you will get a negative number for your answer!  Note: When typing, such as in e mail, the \"pipe\" is usually used to indicate absolute value. The \"pipe\" is probably a shift key somewhere north of the \"Enter\" key on your keyboard. While the \"pipe\" denoted on the physical keyboard key may look broken, the typed character should display on your screen as a solid line. If you cannot locate a \"pipe\" character, you can use \"abs \" instead, so that \"the absolute value of negative 3\" would be typed as \"abs ï¿½3 \". Here are some more sample simplifications:  Simplify | ï¿½8 |.  | ï¿½8 | = 8 Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  Simplify | 0 ï¿½ 6 |.  | 0 ï¿½ 6 | = | ï¿½6 | = 6  Simplify | 5 ï¿½ 2 |.  | 5 ï¿½ 2 | = | 3 | = 3  Simplify | 2 ï¿½ 5 |.  | 2 ï¿½ 5 | = | ï¿½3 | = 3  Simplify | 0 ï¿½4 |.  | 0 ï¿½4 | = | 0 | = 0  Simplify | 2 + 3 ï¿½4 |.  | 2 + 3 ï¿½4 | = | 2 ï¿½ 12 | = | ï¿½10 | = 10  Simplify ï¿½| ï¿½4 |.  ï¿½| ï¿½4| = ï¿½ 4 = ï¿½4  Simplify ï¿½| ï¿½2 2 |.  ï¿½| ï¿½2 2 | = ï¿½| 4 | = ï¿½4  Simplify ï¿½| ï¿½2 |2  ï¿½| ï¿½2 |2 = ï¿½ 2 2 = ï¿½ 4 = ï¿½4  Simplify ï¿½| ï¿½2 | 2.  ï¿½| ï¿½2 | 2 = ï¿½ 2 2 = ï¿½2 2 = 4  Sometimes you will be asked to insert an inequality sign between two absolute values, such as:  Insert the correct inequality: | ï¿½4 | _____ | ï¿½7 |  Whereas ï¿½4   ï¿½7 it is further to the right than is ï¿½7 , we are dealing here with the absolute values. Since: | ï¿½4 | = 4 | ï¿½7 | = 7, ...and 4   7, then the solution is: | ï¿½4 |   | ï¿½7 |.    Note that, whenever we took the absolute value of a number, if it was positive to start with, we left the sign an understood \"+\" alone, but if it was negative to start with, we changed the sign the \"minus\" sign \"ï¿½\" was turned into an understood \"+\" . This leads to one fiddly point which may not come up now, but will probably come up later:  When you are dealing with , you cannot tell the sign of the number or value that is contained in the variable. For instance, given the variable x, you cannot tell by looking whether there is, say, a \"2\" or a \"ï¿½4\" contained inside. So if I ask you for the absolute value of x, what would you do? Since you cannot tell just by looking whether or not the variable contains a positive or negative value, you would have to consider cases.  If x   0 that is, if x is positive , then the value won't change when you take the absolute value. For instance, if x = 2, then you have | x | = | 2 | = 2 = x. In fact, for any positive or zero value of x, the sign would be unchanged, so:  For x   0, | x | = x  On the other hand, if x   0 that is, if x is negative , then it will change its sign when you take the absolute value. For instance, if x = ï¿½4, then | x | = | ï¿½4 | = + 4 = ï¿½ ï¿½4 = ï¿½x. In fact, for any negative value of x, the sign would have to be changed, so:  For x   0, | x | = ï¿½x  This is a case in which the \"minus\" sign does not indicate \"a number to the left of zero\", but \"a change of the sign from whatever the sign originally was\". This \"ï¿½\" does not mean \"the number is negative\" but instead means that \"I've changed the sign on the original value\".

In the year 2012, John and William will be twelve years older, so their ages will be J + 12 and W + 12. Also, John will be three times as old as William, so J + 12 = 3 W + 12 . So now you've got two equations, each with two variables:  J = 11W J + 12 = 3W + 36 If you know how to solve systems of equations, you can proceed with those techniques. Otherwise, use the first equation to simplify the second; since J = 11W, plug in \"11W \" for \"J \" in the second equation:  J + 12 = 3W + 36 11W + 12 = 3W + 36 11W ï¿½ 3W = 36 ï¿½ 12 8W = 24 W = 3 Remember that the problem did not ask for the value of the variable W; it asked for the age of a person. So the answer is: William was three years old at the beginning of the year 2000.    The important things here were to set up the variables, labelling them all clearly, and then to increment the variables by the required amount in this case, by 12 to reflect the passage of time. Don't try to use the same expression to stand for two different things. If \"J \" stands for John's age in 2000, then \"J \" can not stand for his age in 2012. Make sure that you are very explicit about this when you set up your equations; write down the two sets of information their ages at the first time, and their ages at the second time as two distinct situations.  In three more years, Miguel's grandfather will be six times as old as Miguel was last year. When Miguel's present age is added to his grandfather's present age, the total is 68. How old is each one now?  This problem refers not only to their present ages, but also to both their ages last year and their ages in three years, so labelling will be very important. Let Miguel's present age be \"m\"; let his grandfather's age be \"g\". Then m + g = 68. Miguel's age \"last year\" was m ï¿½ 1. His grandfather's age \"in three more years\" will be g + 3. The grandfather's age three years from now is six times Miguel's age last year; in other words: g + 3 = 6 m ï¿½ 1 This gives you two equations with two variables: m + g = 68 g + 3 = 6 m ï¿½ 1 Solving the first equation, you get m = 68 ï¿½ g. Note: It's okay to solve for \"g = 68 ï¿½ m\", too. The problem will work out a bit differently in the middle, but the answer will be the same at the end. Plug this into the second equation: g + 3 = 6m ï¿½ 6 g + 3 = 6 68 ï¿½ g ï¿½ 6 g + 3 = 408 ï¿½ 6g ï¿½ 6 g + 3 = 402 ï¿½ 6g g + 6g = 402 ï¿½ 3 7g = 399 g = 57 Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved Since \"g\" stands for the grandfather's current age, then the grandfather is 57 years old. Since m + g = 68, then m = 11, and Miguel is presently eleven years old.  One half of Heather's age two years from now plus one third of her age three years ago is twenty years. How old is she now?  This problem refers to Heather's age two years in the future and three years in the past. So I'll pick a variable and label everything clearly: age now: H age two years from now: H + 2 age three years ago: H ï¿½ 3 Now I need certain fractions of these ages: one half of age in two years: 1 2 H + 2 = H 2 + 1 one third of age three years ago: 1 3 H ï¿½ 3 = H 3 ï¿½ 1 The sum of these two numbers is twenty, so I'll add them and set this equal to 20: H 2 + 1 + H 3 ï¿½ 1 = 20 H 2 + H 3 = 20 3H + 2H = 120 5H = 120 H = 24 Heather is 24 years old.  Note: Remember that, when solving equations, you can always check your answer by plugging it into the original problem. If Heather is 24 now, then she will be 26 in two years, half of which is 13, and she was 21 three years ago, a third of which is 7. Adding, 13 + 7 = 20, so the solution works.    The following problem is an old one, but it keeps cropping up in various forms:  \"Here lies Diophantus,\" the wonder behold . . .  Through art algebraic, the stone tells how old:  \"God gave him his boyhood one sixth of his life,  One twelfth more as youth while whiskers grew rife;  And then yet one seventh ere marriage begun;  In five years there came a bouncing new son.  Alas, the dear child of master and sage  After attaining half the measure of his fathers life  chill fate took him.  After consoling his fate by this science of numbers for four years, he ended his life.\" Find Diophantus' age at death. Let d be Diophantus' age at death. Then: childhood: d 6 adolescence: d 12 bachelorhood: d 7 childless marriage: 5 age of child at death: d 2 life after child's death: 4 So his whole life had been divided into intervals which, when added together, give the sum of his life. That is: .d 6 + d 12 + d 7 + 5 + d 2 + 4 = d 25 28 d + 9 = d 9 = d ï¿½ 25 28 d 9 = 3 28 d 84 = d Diophantus lived to be 84 years old.  You can check the answer if you like, by plugging \"84\" into the original problem. If he lived to be 84, then one sixth of his life is 14 years, one twelfth of his life is 7 years so he'd be 21, and he certainly should have a beard by this age , one seventh of his life is 12 years so he didn't marry until he was 33 years old , his child was born when he was 38, the boy died at 42 when Diophantus was 80 , and then Diophantus died four years later.    When you've got the time, checking your answers like this is a good idea on tests. In any case, always try to label your variables and expressions clearly, as this will go a long way toward helping you get your equations set up correctly.

They can also arise in other contexts, such as logarithms, but you'll almost certainly first encounter asymptotes in the context of rationals. Let's consider the following equation:  This is a rational function. More to the point, this is a fraction. Can you have a zero in the denominator of a fraction? No. So if I set the denominator of the above fraction equal to zero and solve, this will tell me the values that x cannot be:  x2 ï¿½ 5x ï¿½ 6 = 0 x ï¿½ 6 x + 1 = 0 x = 6 or ï¿½1 So x cannot be 6 or ï¿½1, because then I'd be dividing by zero.  Now look at the graph:  You can see how the graph avoided the lines x = 6 and x = ï¿½1. This is because x cannot be ï¿½1 or 6. In other words, the fact that the function's domain is restricted is reflected in the function's graph. More usefully, you can use the domain to help you graph, because whichever values are not allowed in the domain are vertical asymptotes on the graph.  You can draw the vertical asymptote as a dashed line to remind you not to graph there, like this:  It's alright that the graph appears to climb right up the sides of the asymptote on the left. This is common. Just don't draw the graph crossing the vertical asymptote, and you'll be fine. Let's review this relationship between the domain and the vertical asymptotes.  Find the domain and vertical asymptotes s , if any, of the following function:  The domain is the set of all x values that I'm allowed to use. The only values that could be disallowed are those that give me a zero in the denominator. So I'll set the denominator equal to zero and solve.  x2 + 2x ï¿½ 8 = 0 x + 4 x ï¿½ 2 = 0 x = ï¿½4 or x = 2 Since I can't have a zero in the denominator, then I can't have x = ï¿½4 or x = 2 in the domain. This tells me that the vertical asymptotes which tell me where the graph can't go will be at x = ï¿½4 or x = 2.  domain: vertical asymptotes: x = ï¿½4, 2 Note that the domain and vertical asymptotes are opposites. The vertical asymptotes are at ï¿½4 and 2, and the domain is everywhere but ï¿½4 and 2. This is always true. Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  Find the domain and vertical asymptote s , if any, of the following function:  To find the domain and vertical asymptotes, I'll set the denominator equal to zero and solve. The solutions will be the values that are not allowed in the domain, and will also be the vertical asymptotes.  x2 + 9 = 0 x2 = ï¿½9 Oops! That doesn't solve! So there are no zeroes in the denominator. Since there are no zeroes in the denominator, then there are no forbidden x values, and the domain is \"all x\". Also, since there are no values forbidden to the domain, there are no vertical asymptotes.  domain: all x vertical asymptotes: none Note again how the domain and vertical asymptotes were opposites of each other.  Find the domain and vertical asymptote s , if any, of the following function:  I'll check the zeroes of the denominator:  x2 + 5x + 6 = 0 x + 3 x + 2 = 0 x = ï¿½3 or x = ï¿½2 Since I can't divide by zero, then I have vertical asymptotes at x = ï¿½3 and x = ï¿½2, and the domain is all other x values.  domain: vertical asymptotes: x = ï¿½3 and x = ï¿½2 When graphing, remember that vertical asymptotes stand for x values that are not allowed. Vertical asymptotes are sacred ground. Never, on pain of death, can you cross a vertical asymptote. Don't try!      Related topics: , Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel  2000 2005 All Rights Reserved "

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  Asymptotes   II  Lesson pages: , Horizontal asymptotes, ,   Horizontal asymptotes  Whereas vertical asymptotes are sacred ground, horizontal asymptotes are just useful suggestions. Whereas you can never touch a vertical asymptote, you can and often do touch and even cross horizontal asymptotes. Whereas vertical asymptotes indicate very specific behavior on the graph , usually close to the origin, horizontal asymptotes indicate general behavior far off to the sides of the graph. To get the idea of horizontal asymptotes, let's looks at some simple examples.  Find the horizontal asymptote of the following function:  The horizontal asymptote tells you, roughly, where the graph will go when x is really, really big. So let's look at some big values for x.  x  ï¿½100 000  ï¿½0.0000099...  ï¿½10 000  ï¿½0.0000999...  ï¿½1 000  ï¿½0.0009979...  ï¿½100  ï¿½0.0097990...  ï¿½10  ï¿½0.0792079...  ï¿½1  0.5  0  2  1  1.5  10  0.1188118...  100  0.0101989...  1 000  0.0010019...  10 000  0.0001000...  100 000  0.0000100...  Do you see how, off to the sides of the graph, where x is strongly negative such as ï¿½1,000 or strongly positive such as 10000 , the \"+2\" and the \"+1\" in the expression for y really don't matter so much? Mostly you end up having a really big number divided by a really big number squared, which simplifies to be a very small number. The y value comes mostly from the \"x\" and the \"x2\". And since the x2 is \"bigger\" than the x, the x2 drags the whole fraction down to y = 0 that is, the x axis when x gets big.  You can see this behavior on the graph:  As you can see, the graph shows some slightly interesting behavior near the origin, but the rest of the graph is fairly boring, trailing along the x axis.  In this zoomed in image, you can also see that the graph crosses the horizontal asymptote at the arrow :  As I mentioned before, it is common and perfectly okay to cross a horizontal asymptote. It's the verticals that you're not allowed to touch. Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved As we saw from the table of values and from the graph, the horizontal asymptote is the x axis. horizontal asymptote: y = 0 the x axis In the above problem, the degree on the denominator 2 was bigger than the degree on the numerator 1 , and the horizontal asymptote was y = 0 the x axis . This property is always true: If the degree on x in the denominator is larger than the degree on x in the numerator, then the denominator, being \"stronger\", pulls the fraction down to the x axis when x gets big. That is, if the polynomial in the denominator has a bigger leading exponent than the polynomial in the numerator, then the graph trails along the x axis at the far right and the far left of the graph.    What happens if the degrees are the same in the numerator and denominator?  Find the horizontal asymptote of the following:  Unlike the previous example, this function has degree 2 polynomials top and bottom. That is, the degrees are the same in the numerator and the denominator. Since the degrees are the same, the numerator and denominator \"pull\" evenly; this graph should not drag down to the x axis, nor should it shoot off to infinity. But where does it go?  Again, think in terms of big values for x. When x is really big, I'll have, roughly, twice something big minus an eleven divided by once something big plus a nine . As you might guess from the last problem, for big values of x, the \"ï¿½11\" and the \"+9\" won't matter much, so I'll roughly have \"2x2 x2\", which reduces to just 2. Does a table of values bear this out? Let's check:  x  ï¿½100 000  1.9999999...  ï¿½10 000  1.9999997...  ï¿½1 000  1.9999710...  ï¿½100  1.9971026...  ï¿½10  1.7339449...  ï¿½1  ï¿½0.9  0  ï¿½1.2222222...  1  ï¿½0.9  10  1.7339449...  100  1.9971026...  1 000  1.9999710...  10 000  1.9999997...  100 000  1.9999999...  As you can see, for big values of x, the graph is very close to y = 2.  The graph reflects this:  Then the answer is: horizontal asymptote: y = 2  In this example, the degree on the numerator and denominator was the same, and the horizontal asymptote was the horizontal line found by dividing the leading coefficients of the two polynomials. This is always true: When the degrees of the numerator and the denominator are the same, then the horizontal asymptote is found by dividing the leading terms, so the asymptote is given by:  y = numerator's leading coefficient denominator's leading coefficient       Related topics: , Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel  2000 2005 All Rights Reserved "

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  Number Bases  The Conversion Method:  Why Does It Work?  Consider first the binary case:  When you divide a number by two, the remainder will be either a zero or a one. If the remainder is 0, then the base ten number must have been even that is, a multiple of two , so there will be no ones, and therefore the right most digit will be \"0\". If the remainder is 1, then the base ten number must have been odd that is, one more than a multiple of two , so there will be a \"1\" as the right most digit in the units column.  Now divide again by two. If the remainder is zero, then, after getting rid of any extra 1 from being an odd number , the number that was left must be a multiple of four, so there won't be any 2 left over. Otherwise, there was a multiple of two left over, so there will be a 1 in the twos column. Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  Continue in like manner. Each time you divide, you're asking \"Does the original number contain a multiple of this power of two?\", and the remainder is either telling you \"yes\" with a \"0\" or \"no\" with a \"1\" .  This reasoning carries through with other bases. If, say, you're converting to base eleven and you divide by 11, the remainder will tell you how many more than a multiple of eleven the given number is. Since this remainder value must be between 0 if the number is an exact multiple of eleven and 10 one less than a multiple of eleven , then the digits in a base eleven number will never contain one single solitary digit for \"eleven\".

Reasonably, the numerator, being \"stronger\", ought to \"pull\" the graph away from the x axis y = 0 or any other fixed y value. To investigate, let's look at the following graphs. To the left of each graph, compare the original function, the original function after rearrangement by long division, and the polynomial only part of the original function. Then note the similarities between the graphs of the original functions and the graphs of the polynomial only parts of the functions.  original function:  graph of the original function:  long division:  result function:  polynomial part:  graph of polynomial part:  y = ï¿½3x ï¿½ 3  Note the similarity between the two graphs.

Except for where the vertical asymptote causes a break in the middle, the two graphs are practically the same, as you can see from the overlay. As you can see, when the degree is larger in the numerator, the polynomial fraction can be rewritten as a polynomial part plus a fractional part that goes to zero as x gets large because the degree in the fractional part is greater on the bottom . This is similar to the process of converting an improper fraction, such as 5 3, into a mixed number, like 1 2 3. In these cases, the graphs ends up, at the sides, looking like the polynomial part of the rational function.  In the examples above, the numerator's degree was 1, 2, 3, and 4 more than the denominator's. In practice, however, you will be dealing only with rationals where the numerator's degree is, at most, one greater than that of the denominator. You will then do the long division to reduce the fraction to a \"mixed polynomial\", with a straight line part because it is of degree 1 and a fractional part which goes to zero off to the far right and far left of the graph .  Since the graph then will be, roughly, a slanty straight line on the ends, this asymptote is called a \"slant\" or \"oblique\" asymptote, and the equation for the slant asymptote is the polynomial part of the rational that you get after doing the long division.  Find the slant asymptote of the following function:  To find the slant asymptote, I'll do the long division:  The slant asymptote is the polynomial part of the answer, not the remainder.  slant asymptote: y = x + 5        regarding the horizontal and slant asymptote rules.

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  Asymptotes   IV  Lesson pages: , , , Worked examples   Worked examples  In general, you will be given rational fractional expressions, and you will have to find the domain and any asymptotes. So you will need to know what steps to take and how to recognize the different types of asymptotes. Here are some examples.  Find the domain and all asymptotes of the following function:  The vertical asymptotes and any restrictions on the domain come from the zeroes of the denominator, so I'll set the denominator equal to zero and solve.  4x2 ï¿½ 9 = 0 4x2 = 9 x2 = 9 4 x = ï¿½ 3 2 Then the domain is all x values other than ï¿½ 3 2, and the two vertical asymptotes are at x = ï¿½ 3 2.  Since the degrees of the numerator and the denominator are the same each being 2 , then this rational has a non zero non x axis horizontal asymptote, not a slant asymptote, and the horizontal asymptote is found by dividing the leading terms:  Then the full answer is: Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  domain: vertical asymptotes: x = ï¿½ 3 2 horizontal asymptote: y = 1 4 slant asymptote: none Note: You may or may not have a vertical asymptote depending upon whether the denominator ever equals zero , but you will always have a horizontal or slant asymptote in these problems. However, you will only have one of the two. That is, you will have either a horizontal asymptote or else a slant asymptote, but not both. As soon as you see that you'll have one, don't bother looking for the other.  Find the domain and all asymptotes of the following function:  The vertical asymptotes come from the zeroes of the denominator, so I'll set the denominator equal to zero and solve.  x2 + 9 = 0 x2 = ï¿½9 Oops! This has no solution. Since the denominator has no zeroes, then there are no vertical asymptotes and the domain is \"all x\".  Since the degree is greater in the denominator than in the numerator, the y values will be dragged down to the x axis, and the horizontal asymptote is therefore \"y = 0\". Since I have found a horizontal asymptote, I don't have to look for a slant asymptote. Then the full answer is:  domain: all x vertical asymptotes: none horizontal asymptote: y = 0 the x axis slant asymptote: none Find the domain and all asymptotes of the following function:  Note that this can be simplified as:  The temptation is to say that y equals x + 1 and therefore that this has no vertical asymptote. But the original function does have a zero in the denominator at x = 2, so while the graph of y will look very much like x + 1, it will not quite be the same.  Since the degree of the numerator is one greater than the degree of the denominator, I'll have a slant asymptote not a horizontal one , and I'll find the slant asymptote by long division.  Hmm... There wasn't any remainder when I divided. Actually, that makes sense: since x ï¿½ 2 is a factor of the numerator and I'm dividing by x ï¿½ 2, the division should come out evenly. Then the full answer is:  domain: vertical asymptotes: x = 2 horizontal asymptote: none slant asymptote: y = x + 1 Note: When you go to graph the function in this last example, you will draw the line right on the horizontal asymptote, but you will leave a nice open dot where x = 2, to indicate that this point is not included. This last case is not the norm for slant asymptotes, but you should expect to see at least one problem of this type, including perhaps on the test.    In general, the procedure for asymptotes is the following:  set the denominator equal to zero and solve  the zeroes if any are the vertical asymptotes  everything else is the domain  compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator  if the degrees are the same, then you have a horizontal asymptote at y = numerator's leading coefficient denominator's leading coefficient if the denominator's degree is greater by any margin , then you have a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 the x axis if the numerator's degree is greater by a margin of 1 , then you have a slant asymptote which you will find by doing long division  When you're working these problems, try to go through these steps in order, so you can remember them on the test. They're not so hard once you get the hang of them, so be sure to do plenty of practice.      Related topics: , Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel  2000 2005 All Rights Reserved "

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  Calculator Advice  Many schools now require calculators. This site is not the place for a discussion of the problems financial and otherwise that this can cause, or of the \"philosophy\" on which these policies are often based. If you are interested in the politically incorrect side of this issue, visit . But if you are wondering which calculator to buy, here is my advice. And for an interesting discussion of the value of a broken calculator, try ! If you are looking for a \"scientific\" or \"business\" or \"statistics\" calculator, then there are many options. You can find very affordable calculators at office supplies, discount department stores, and electronics stores, among other places. I have only two recommendations. First, make sure that the calculator has a fraction key; it looks like this:  Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  Trust me: You'll love it!  Second, if you have never used a calculator before or if it's been a really long time , consider buying a calculator from the Sharp \"D.A.L.\" Direct Algebraic Logic series. The key sequencing is simpler, which makes it easier to learn than the \"regular\" calculators. Note: More and more producers are designing their calculators to use the simpler syntax, so you may find that another brand works just as easily for you. If you are supposed to get a \"Texas Instruments graphing calculator utility\", then you would want a TI 83 or TI 83 Plus, or TI 83 Plus Silver, or... , if you are doing lower level algebra and nothing more, or a TI 86, if you're going on to do more algebra, calculus, etc. Do NOT get a TI 92 unless you have verified that your school allows them; many schools are banning them. For some reason, though TI 89 has many of the same capabilities that are getting the TI 92 banned, the TI 89 is generally allowed. However, it would still be a good idea to check first. Note that many most? instructors, especially at the high school level, don't know how to use the TI 86,  89, or  92, so you'll be on your own when it comes to learning how to use them. And their owners manuals tend to be the size of small textbooks.  Texas Instruments has recently summer 2005 come out with the TI 84, an update of their TI 83 which incorporates many of their new capabilities increased memory, computer connectivity, default apps, etc but which is backwards compatible with the TI 83. The TI 84 will allow you to do more while remaining compatible keystroke for keystroke with the TI 83 that your teacher is using. If you are supposed to get a TI 83, you might want to look at spending a little more to get the TI 84. However, the 84 assumes that you have reliable access to a fairly new computer. Much of the manual is accessible only through the CD that comes with the calculator, calculator to computer connectivity relies on USB ports, and you may need to download and install at 23 meg Micro$oft program .NET Framework to get the computer side of the calculator to work. You may also need to upgrade your browser, since the TI 84 appears to require the most up to date version of Internet Explorer. So I would recommend the TI 84 over the TI 83 for the updated capabilities, but only if you have ready access to an updated computer and a good Internet connection.  If the only specification is that you are to get \"a graphing utility\", then the choice is up to you. Many companies produce perfectly nice calculators, but the textbooks and teachers usually push the Texas Instruments TI 83. If you're willing and able to read the manual for yourself, then get whatever calculator you like. Otherwise, stick with Texas Instruments.  If your choice is to get the TI 82 or TI 83, get the TI 83; if your choice is the TI 85 or TI 86, get the TI 86. In either case, do NOT get the TI 80 or  81. There are too many things that you'll need to do that they aren't capable of doing; a TI 80 or  81 will not get the job done.  By the way, if you already have a TI 85, and would like to have the \"TABLE\" feature that the TI 82, TI 83, and TI 86 have, use my \"\" program. The page in the preceding link contains the program as a text file; you'll have to type the program into your calculator yourself. If you do get a TI 8X calculator, learn where the \"convert to fraction\" menu item is this varies from model to model; check your manual . The command looks like this:  This command will convert the last value to its fractional form, if possible. It's a very handy command. If you have the \"Custom\" menu option, install the \"convert to fraction\" command on your custom menu, for convenience sake. If you are thinking of getting a Hewlett Packard HP calculator graphing or otherwise , see if you can find a friend or fellow student who will let you borrow one. In my experience, people either love HPs or they hate them, and it would be a shame to spend a couple hundred dollars just to learn that you're one of the ones who hates 'em. They slice, they dice, they whistle \"Dixie\", but they might not be your cup of tea. Take a good look first.  If there is no specification on which calculator you should get or if you are given a choice , and you are planning on entering a scientific field of study math, engineering, or physics, for instance, as opposed to Poly Sci or French Lit , then you might want to contact the appropriate department to see if the department specifies which calculator to use. Be forewarned: It is entirely possible that you will be required to buy multiple calculators: one for the math department, another for the physics department, and another for the engineering department. Calculators are very trendy, and the trend oids don't often think about the real world implications of their policies.  There; now ya know: I'm politically incorrect.    If you have lost the manual to your Texas Instruments graphing calculator, look into downloading a new copy . Click on \"Graphing\" for current models, or scroll down a bit and click on \"Discontinued Products Guidebooks\" for older models. The guidebooks are Adobe Acrobat documents, and fairly large ones at that, so you might want to download the manual one chapter at a time if you have a slow or twitchy connection.

This isn't the time to worry about that square on the x. I need to just apply the Theorem. The first term in the binomial is \"x2\", the second term in \"3\", and the power n is 6, so, counting from 0 to 6, the Binomial Theorem gives me:  x2 + 3 6 = 6C0 x2 6 3 0 + 6C1 x2 5 3 1 + 6C2 x2 4 3 2 + 6C3 x2 3 3 3 + 6C4 x2 2 3 4 + 6C5 x2 1 3 5 + 6C6 x2 0 3 6  Then simplifying gives me:  1 x12 1 + 6 x10 3 + 15 x8 9 + 20 x6 27 + 15 x4 81 + 6 x2 243 + 1 1 729 = x12 + 18x10 + 135x8 + 540x6 + 1215x4 + 1458x2 + 729  Expand 2x ï¿½ 5y 7  I'll plug \"2x\", \"ï¿½5y\", and \"7\" into the Binomial Theorem, counting up from zero to seven to get each term.

So memorize the Theorem and get the easy points.  What is the fourth term in the expansion of 3x ï¿½ 2 10?  I've already expanded this binomial, so let's take a look:  3x ï¿½ 2 10 = 10C0 3x 10ï¿½0 ï¿½2 0 + 10C1 3x 10ï¿½1 ï¿½2 1 + 10C2 3x 10ï¿½2 ï¿½2 2 + 10C3 3x 10ï¿½3 ï¿½2 3 + 10C4 3x 10ï¿½4 ï¿½2 4 + 10C5 3x 10ï¿½5 ï¿½2 5 + 10C6 3x 10ï¿½6 ï¿½2 6 + 10C7 3x 10ï¿½7 ï¿½2 7 + 10C8 3x 10ï¿½8 ï¿½2 8 + 10C9 3x 10ï¿½9 ï¿½2 9 + 10C10 3x 10ï¿½10 ï¿½2 10 So the fourth term is not the one where I've counted up to 4, but the one where I've counted up just to 3.  Note that, in any expansion, there is one more term than the number in the power. For instance:  x + y 2 = x2 + 2xy + y2 second power: three terms x + y 3 = x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3 third power: four terms x + y 4 = x4 + 4x3y + 6x2y2 + 4xy3 + y4 fourth power: five terms The expansion in this problem, 3x ï¿½ 2 10, has power of n = 10, so the expansion will have eleven terms, and the terms will count up, not from 1 to 10 or from 1 to 11, but from 0 to 10. This is why the fourth term will not the one where I'm using \"4\" as my counter, but will be the one where I'm using \"3\".  10C3 3x 10ï¿½3 ï¿½2 3 = 120 2187 x7 ï¿½8 = ï¿½2099520x7  Find the tenth term in the expansion of x + 3 12.  To find the tenth term, I plug x, 3, and 12 into the Binomial Theorem, using the number 10 ï¿½ 1 = 9 as my counter:  12C9 x 12ï¿½9 3 9 = 220 x3 19683 = 4330260x3  Find the middle term in the expansion of 4x ï¿½ y 8.  Since this binomial is to the power 8, there will be nine terms in the expansion, which makes the fifth term the middle one. So I'll plug 4x, ï¿½y, and 8 into the Binomial Theorem, using the number 5 ï¿½ 1 = 4 as my counter.  8C4 4x 8ï¿½4 ï¿½y 4 = 70 64x4 y4 = 4480x4y4  You might be asked to work backwards.  Express 1296x12 ï¿½ 4320x9y2 + 5400x6y4 ï¿½ 3000x3y6 + 625y8 in the form a + b n.  I know that the first term is of the form an, because, for whatever n is, the first term is nC0 which always equals 1 times an times b0 which also equals 1 . So 1296x12 = an. By the same reasoning, the last term is bn, so 625y8 = bn. And since there are alternating \"plus\" and \"minus\" signs, I know from experience that the sign in the middle has to be a \"minus\". If all the signs had been \"plusses\", then the middle sign would have been a \"plus\" also. But in this case, I'm really looking for \" a ï¿½ b n\". I know that, for any power n, the expansion has n + 1 terms. Since this has 5 terms, this tells me that n = 4. So to find a and b, I only have to take the 4th root of the first and last terms of the expanded polynomial:  Then a = 6x3, b = 5y2, there is a \"minus\" sign in the middle, and:  1296x12 ï¿½ 4320x9y2 + 5400x6y4 ï¿½ 3000x3y6 + 625y8 = 6x3 ï¿½ 5y2 4  Don't let the Binomial Theorem scare you. It's just another formula to memorize. A really complicated and annoying formula, I'll grant you, but just a formula, nonetheless. Don't overthink the Theorem; there is nothing deep or meaningful here. Just memorize it, and move on.      Related topics: , Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved "

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  \"The Bible says pi = 3\"  Does the Bible really say that the value of pi is three? Not actually, but, due to the social pressures to look down on all things Judeo Christian, this old chestnut certainly does get a lot of air time. Let's lay a little background before .  The Quote  \"And he Hiram made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one rim to the other it was round all about, and...a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about....And it was an hand breadth thick....\" ï¿½ First Kings, chapter 7, verses 23 and 26  There is a similar description, giving the same measurements, in First Chronicles 4, verses 2 through 5.  Hiram and the Phoenicians  The Phoenicians lived in what is now Lebanon. They were the creators of \"royal purple\", made by boiling a particular sea snail. While they did not invent glass, they did invent glass blowing. They invented the first alphabet, from which we derive our own Latin alphabet. And they were skilled builders and artisans who exported their talents along with their wood products, \"the cedars of Lebanon\".  Hiram was the Phoenician artisan hired by King Solomon to design and supervise the building of the Jewish temple. The bowl \"sea\" at issue was used within the temple.  The Measurements  The text refers to dimensions measured in \"cubits\" and \"handbreadths\". Back in those days, measurements were not standardized as they are now. People used seat of the pants measurements. Have you ever estimated the length of a bookcase by seeing how long it was compared to your outstretched arms? And then walked over to the spot where you wanted to move the bookcase, and stood against the wall, making sure that the length you'd just measured against your own body would fit in the open space? If so, then you have used \"measurements\" similar to those that ancient civilizations used.  The cubit was the length from the elbow to the tip of the outstretched fingers. It is commonly \"standardized\" today as being about eighteen inches or about forty six centimeters . To measure the length of, say, a desk in cubits, you would put your elbow at one end of the desk, with your hand outstretched toward the other end of the desk. Put the index finger of your other hand on the desk where your outstretched fingertips end, to mark the end of that cubit. Then move your cubit arm over your index finger which is marking the first cubit so your elbow is now at your index finger, with your outstretched fingers still aiming at the other end of the desk. This measures \"two cubits\". Continue laying out cubits until you run out of desk, counting as you go. My desk, being seventy two inches long, comes out to being about four and a half cubits long, as measured by my forearm.  A handsbreadth is the \"hand\" used to measure horses. It is the width of the palm of the person doing the measuring, and is \"standardized\" as being four inches or about ten centimeters . To measure, say, the height of a desk, start at the floor. Open your left hand with your palm facing you and your thumb up in the air so it's out of the way . Rest your hand on the floor, with the back of your open hand against the desk, your palm still facing you, and your \"pinkie\" finger on the floor. Now open your right hand again sticking your thumb up in the air so it's out of the way , and rest it on top of your left hand so your right \"pinkie\" finger is across the top of your left index finger . This measures \"two hands\". Continue alternating hands up the side of your desk, counting as you go. My desk, being thirty inches tall, comes out to being about eleven handbreadths, as measured by my skinny little hands.  Since cubits and handbreadths are measured against a person's body, and since bodies vary, actual measurements as opposed to \"standardized\" measurements will vary from person to person. Your desk might be thirty inches tall, just like mine, but you might have bigger hands, so you might get a body measure of only ten handbreadths. This variation is normal. Since we have no idea what Hiram's body measurements were, we'll have to approximate by using the standardized values for cubits and handbreadths.  Some Reasonable Assumptions  If this discussion of a \"sea\", or large bowl, had been referring to what is called an \"ideal\" bowl a mathematical object, not existing in a physical sense, and having no thickness that could be felt or handled , then the text would indeed be claiming that the value of pi is three. But the text is referring to a real world physical object, having the thick sidewalls necessary to support its own weight.  Now that you know how to measure cubits, can you see that it would be rather difficult to measure the curved surface of a bowl in cubits? Instead, a straightened rope would be used to measure the length. The rope would then have been moved to outline a circle with the desired circumference. Also, Hiram would not have just tossed some brass in the furnace and waited to see what came out. He would have designed the piece and would have given his workmen instructions.  To make a \"sea\" like this would likely have required a mold. The outer mold would have one dimension, and the inner mold would have another. Hiram would have given his workmen instructions regarding these measurements.  Wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that the Phoenicians, being the renowned craftsmen that they were, had discovered a \"rule of thumb\"? Perhaps something along the lines of, \"If a bowl is made with a three to one ratio between the inner circumference and the outer diameter, the bowl will have a desirable wall thickness that will support its own weight\"? When Egyptians and Babylonians came up with rules of thumb or accidentally discovered formulae like this, we credit them with being clever. Can't we do the same for the Phoenicians, regardless of the fact that they were ï¿½ gasp! ï¿½ friendly with the Jews?  Now that you have some background, let's look at the numbers:    The Here again is the quote being referred to:  \"And he Hiram made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one rim to the other it was round all about, and...a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about....And it was an hand breadth thick....\" ï¿½ First Kings, chapter 7, verses 23 and 26  The bowl is said to have had a circumference of thirty cubits and a diameter of ten cubits. The diameter is said to be \"from one rim to the other\", so this would be the outer diameter; that is, the diameter of the outer mold used to make the bowl.  The circumference is not specified as being the inner or outer circumference, but, since using the outer circumference would give us the \"ideal\" bowl with no width or thickness , let's instead use the inner circumference, which also, reasonably, would have been the circumference of the mold used to form the inside of the bowl. That is, we will use the two measurements which were necessary for the making of the bowl.  So, using eighteen inches for one cubit, we have the following:  outer diameter: 10 cubits, or 180 inches outer radius: 5 cubits, or 90 inches inner circumference: 30 cubits, or 540 inches  To find the \"Jewish\" or \"Bible\" value for pi, we need to have the inner radius, in order to be able to plug this into the formula for the circumference and compare with the given circumference value of 540 inches.  Since the thickness of the bowl is given as one handsbreadth, then the inner radius must be 90 ï¿½ 4 = 86 inches:  Let's do the calculations:  inner radius: 86 inches inner circumference: 540 inches  The circumference formula is:  C = 2 pi r  ...which gives us:  540 = 2 pi 86 540 = 172 pi Then pi = 540 172 = 135 43 = 3.1395348837..., or about 3.14.  Um... Isn't \"3.14\" the approximation we all use for pi? Hmm.... I guess the Phoenicians were fairly accurate after all.  Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel  2000 2005 All Rights Reserved "

Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  Supplementary Books  This page isn't a lesson; it's more along the lines of book reviews and advice. It is arranged in sections, according to the reason you may be looking for a book. Hyperlinked titles are connected to Amazon.com, for convenience of purchase. Note that you may be able to find some of these books in your local library. If you don't understand the textbook:  You might have one of those fashionable textbooks that doesn't actually teach math, which can be very confusing. If this is the case, you may have to look into getting your math elsewhere another school, another section of the class, a tutor, etc. . For an in depth look at this \"new new\" math, see . But if you have a \"normal\" textbook that you just happen not to like very much, then you do have some options.  You can always get tutoring, but that can cost quite a bit, unless you go the free . On the other hand, you may be able to pick up a used algebra textbook for next to nothing. Go to your local used book store and take a look.  In addition, there are books such as Bob Miller's \"\". This is not a textbook, in that the book is not divided into the sections that you're familiar with, nor does it contain lists of homework problems. But the book covers much of basic algebra, and contains clear, practical explanations, along with worked examples. The book is an affordable paperback.  Recommendation: high school, homeschool, or college students. There are many supplemental books, such as the for algebra brought to you by the \"Cliffs Notes\" people . This is a very user friendly lesson book. Note that the Cliffs Quick Review books for and are more intended for review of material you have already studied. As such, they tend to be short on instruction and practice problems. The Quick Reviews are great if you just need a little help, but if you're needing lots of help, stick with the Study Solver.  Recommendation: high school, homeschool, or college students. Another option would be Schaum's Outlines. This series has a book for just about any topic; specifically, there are Outlines for algebra, algebra, algebra, , and college math from . Schaum's Outlines are quite practical, containing concise explanations, clearly worked examples, and lots of practice with \"typical\" exercises. They're also affordable paperbacks, and may be used as textbooks.  Recommendation: high school, homeschool, or college students. If you're having difficulty with only one area of algebra, then you're probably having trouble with word problems. For this, I can recommend Mildred Johnson's \"\". It's a small paperback, divided into chapters according to the type of word problem. The explanations are good, and the mixture of problems with worked solutions is excellent.  Recommendation: high school, homeschool, or college students. Please note that these are not the only math help books; they just happen to be the ones I've reviewed. You can probably find many other similar books at your local bookstore or online. If you follow one of the links above, Amazon.com will likely list quite a few similar books that you can look at. Be sure to read any reviews of the books you're considering, as these reviews may contain additional useful information which could help you decide what book to buy.  If you need to write a book report on a math person:  If you're writing a book report on a math person, then almost certainly you are having to write a \"women in math\" or \"minorities in math\" report. Personally, I fail to see what a person's chromosomes have to do with a person's accomplishments, but, believe it or not, there are entire books out there written just for these types of book reports. You should be able to find something in your school's library.  If, on the other hand, you're really interested in learning about a person's struggles, then I can recommend Robert Kanigel's \"\", a biography of Ramanujan pronounced \"ruh MAH nuh jinn\" . Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyengar was an Indian mathematician, self taught, whose life was one of hardship, trial, frustration, and early death. His genius was not appreciated until too late, and now we are left wondering what might have been. The biography is rather long, but emphasizes his life rather than his mathematics that is, you don't need to be a genius to be able to enjoy the book . If you want to read an inspiring book and learn how culture and politics can impact the sciences, then this could be the book for you.  Recommendation: high school, homeschool, or college students; but make sure you have the time: this is not the book to choose if you need to have the report completed in a week. If you need to do a math report: Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  If you need to do a report strictly on math as opposed to math people , then you have some interesting options.  I'm sure any instructor would be happy to see a report on any book by Keith Devlin, Ivars Peterson, or Theoni Pappas do a search on their names to find quite a few titles , but there are some less obvious options.  Recommendation: high school, homeschool, or college students For instance, many of my students have enjoyed doing reports on Dava Sobel's \"\". This book records the story of the politics surrounding the search for the ability reliably to know one's position, particularly at sea. Nowadays, what with the Global Positioning System GPS , we just don't realize how dangerous travel used to be. It was fairly easy to tell how far north or south you were, as long as you knew what day of the year it was, because you could calculate your latitude from the angle of the sun above the horizon. But for east and west, people had a problem. Even now, when I'm trying not to get lost while driving somewhere, I can keep track of the direction I'm heading in if I know what time it is. If it's eight in the morning and my shadow is off to my left, then, since the sun is busy rising in the east, my shadow must be to the west, so I'm heading north. But if it's noon ish, then the sun is in the south, so my shadow must be north, and I'm heading east. This only works on uncloudly days, of course, which is why you're well advised not to follow my car if you need to get somewhere.  But you can see the idea: you can tell where you are if you know the time, and, for longitude, they needed to know the time to within a very few seconds, or their old wooden boats could get hopelessly lost and they'd end up crashing somewhere that had no food or friendly natives. Then consider that the clocks at that time were powered by pendulums, which wouldn't work too well on a rocking boat, and you can see where they might have had a problem. The quest for a solution, and the money grubbing politics that went along with that quest, make for an interesting read. The mathematics is quite simple, and the book is well written and fairly short.  Recommendation: high school, homeschool, or college students, or just for personal pleasure. Another book I really like is Petr Beckmann's \"\". There is a fair amount of math in this slim volume, but most of it is quite accessible. There is also a great deal of history and opinion. I think Mr. Beckmann was in a bad mood when he wrote this book, because he pretty much slams everybody with particular venom reserved for the Roman and Soviet empires , which makes the book a lot of fun to read. If you're looking for something mathematical but very enjoyable, try this one.  Recommendation: homeschool or college students, or advanced high school students There are some books that are similar, or rather, books that try to be similar, to \"A History of Pi\". But while they each cover some significant number or concept, they don't share the irrascibility of \"A History of Pi\". However, while they might not be nearly the fun that \"A History of Pi\" is, they are perfectly good material for book reports.  is \"\", by Eli Maor. This book excels in its description of the development of logarithms and the gratitude with which the computational world accepted this new tool. The reading gets a bit difficult in the middle it might help to wait to read this until you've taken trigonometry, and maybe some calculus , but the book wraps up with a clear synopsis in the last chapter. For the truly adventuresome, get a slide rule many are sold in online auctions and learn how to use it. Slide rules are built on logarithms; their use vastly simplified calculations, something that most people in this era of cheap electronic calculators just cannot appreciate. If you need a big project mathematical, historical, or cultural , get the slide rule, read this book, and expand your horizons.  Recommendation: advanced college students, homeschool students, or engineers and similar scientific types Another book by Eli Maor is \"\". If you are \"into\" trig, especially if you're heading in a scientific direction like engineering, you might like this book. I would have appreciated more history on the topic, but this book leans more toward the applied side. It gives good explanations of the development of many important areas of applied mathematics.  Recommendation: advanced college students Another book of this genre is \"\", by Paul Nahin. While very complete historically, I found the text to be a bit confusing, both in organization and explanation. I would definitely wait until after calculus to delve into this history of the \"imaginary\". However, for the recreational or precocious student, or for someone with a background in practical science such as engineering , the history and science contained could be invigorating.  Recommendation: homeschool or college students, or engineers or similar scientific types Robert Kaplan has written \"\", a highly literary book on the development and eventual acceptance of the zero concept. He spends a lot of time in wonderings and ponderings; if you can \"trip the light fantastic\" with words, Mr. Kaplan does. This book was a bit flowery for my taste, but if you lean toward the liberal arts, this book could be your cup of tea.  Recommendation: homeschool or college students On the other hand, \"\", by Charles Seife, was just my speed. This book spends more time on the known history than in wondering what happened during the gaps in our knowledge of the past. He humanizes the subject with lots of detail, and his writing style is very enjoyable. It's hard to go wrong with a book that contains a \"proof\" that Winston Churchill is a carrot, and which ponders the implications of humans and gods having infinite amounts of sex. The author makes the mathematics very approachable; you don't need to be familiar with complex numbers, calculus, physics, etc., in order to follow his reasoning. Starting with chapter 7, the book turns from the history of zero to the implications of zero within modern physics, so you might want to restrict your book report to the first six chapters.  Recommendation: high school, homeschool, or college students Robert Kaplan has also written together with his wife Ellen Kaplan. This books considers questions whose answers require a consideration of some aspect of infinity. I enjoyed this book more than \"The Nothing That Is\" above , but would recommend this text only for the gifted or mathematically inclided student. It is not that the material is too difficult, but that it is sort of \"out there\", and you'd need to be really \"into\" math to want to wade through this. Any student could probably benefit from the earlier chapters covering sequences, series, and proofs by induction, and some of the geometry is quite accessible. But the second half of the book is more for devotees of mathematics, such as the chapter on such topics as pencils of points and duality in the projective plane. If your eyes just glazed over when you read that last sentence, then maybe this book isn't for you. This text covers mathematical thinking, and refers to biographical aspects of mathematicians' lives, as well as literature and history. It's a good read, if you're willing to put in the effort.  Recommendation: gifted students or math majors Barry Mazur has written \"\". In this book, Mr. Mazur attempts to lead the reader through the invention discovery? of imaginary numbers. Along the way, he compares the act of \"doing mathematics\" with other acts of creative imagination, such as painting or writing a poem. The author assumes the reader has a literary background, making references to historical facts, novelists, and philosophers, and occasionally quoting French sayings in French . I found the first two thirds or so of the book to be fairly good, though it seemed to trail off a bit in the last third. Still, the exposure to the actual work of mathematicians, with all the sweat and the messiness and the bickering, will be quite illuminating to many. If you think that math is really as sterile as many books present it as being, this text could be an eye opener.  Recommendation: homeschool or college students A book that your teacher will probably like is John Paulos' \"\". Mr. Paulos expounds on why it can be harmful to be unable to deal intelligently with numbers mostly statistics and probability . While his examples are often dated for instance, Margaret Thatcher has not been the prime minister in England for quite a few years now , and his politics tends toward the \"correct\" end of the spectrum, his point is good: you can get in trouble if you don't know enough about numbers to keep yourself from being fooled by scam artists. The book is widely available, easy to read, and relatively short. The only annoyance is when he gets cute and asks a question and then doesn't answer it, as though he's giving you a homework problem. But this doesn't come up much, and the discussion of real life statistics and probability is worth the trouble.  Recommendation: high school, homeschool, or college students Another book along these practial lines tries to explain common errors, rather than just tell you that you should avoid them. \"\", by Colin Bruce, presents original Sherlock Holmes stories, illustrating basic concepts of logic and probability in both common everyday contexts where the errors may be hidden by their familiarity and in simplified contexts where the error is more easily extracted and refuted . This is an easy read; not only can you get a good book report out of this, but you might learn something useful, too.  Recommendation: high school, homeschool, or college students If you're trying to study ahead:  If you're finishing algebra and would like to prepare for calculus, then try a little book called \"\", by Silvanus Thompson. As you can probably guess from the author's first name, this is not a recent book. And it isn't a \"standard\" presentation. But it covers the ideas of calculus in a way that can give you a good grasp of the concepts. If you have the summer to digest this book before starting calculus in the fall, then this could be a useful little volume, especially if you are going to be taking a \"reform\" calculus class, which will try so hard to be \"conceptual\" that it will probably end up being utterly confusing. \"Calculus Made Easy\" is an affordable paperback with explanations, \"useful dodges\" cheats , worked examples, exercises with answers in the back , and the statement by the author that your calculus instructor will probably hate this book.  Recommendation: homeschool or college students, or advanced high school students If you're trying to pull a fast one:  If you are supposed to do some kind of extra credit project, but your teacher hasn't said what it's up to you to think of something , then consider reading a book and analyzing its use of numbers. For instance, you could read a book on current events, economics, or politics. You know that such a book will have some numbers in it, just because it will discuss growth rates and populations and money and such. Review the book's positions and arguments, but specifically review the use of numbers. Did the numbers make sense in context? In the light of other research? Were the numbers interpreted sensibly, or did it seem to you like the author was jumping to conclusions, or even trying to scam you? Did the use of numbers seem reasonable, or would you have liked to see more justification of arguments made, or, on the other hand, did an overabundance of numbers just bury you in confusion?  For this type of book \"review\" as opposed to a mere book \"report\" , you can use anything in current events, economics, or politics. For instance, I would recommend anything that Thomas Sowell has ever written. Or, if you really want to have some fun with this, find something by P.J. O'Rourke that's heavy on the numbers, such as \"\", and watch your teacher get her panties all in a wad.  Recommendation: high school or college students Hey; if you have to invent your own project, it might as well be fun, right?

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  Complex Fractions  I sometimes refer to complex fractions as \"stacked\" fractions, because they tend to have fractions stacked on top of each other, like this:  Simplify the following expression:  This fraction is formed of two fractional expressions, one on top of the other. There are two methods for simplifying complex fractions. The first method if fairly obvious: find for the complex numerator and complex denominator, convert the complex numerator and complex denominator to their respective common denominators, combine everything in the complex numerator and in the complex denominator into single fractions, and then, once you've got one fraction in the complex numerator divided by another fraction in the complex denominator , you flip n multiply. that, when you are dividing by a fraction, you flip the fraction and turn the division into multiplication. This method looks like this:  cancels at this point, so this is the final answer.  The \"for x not equal to zero\" part is because, in the original expression, \"x = 0\" would have caused division by zero in the complex fraction. Depending on your book and instructor, you may not need to . If you're not sure, ask now, before the test. The other method is to find one common denominator for all the fractions in both the complex numerator and the complex denominator, and then multiply both the complex numerator and complex denominator by this expression. Then simplify.  This method looks like this:  Then the final answer is:  By multiplying through, top and bottom, by the same thing, I was really just multiplying by 1. This is similar to multiplying the fraction 1 2 by 2 2 to convert it to 2 4. In my experience, books and teachers often use the first method, but students generally prefer the second method. When I was in school, I was taught the first method. As soon as I encountered the second method, I switched to it. In the remaining examples, I will demonstrate this second method, but you can use either method you prefer.  However, if your text or instructor requires that you find the restrictions on the domains the \"x not equal to zero\" part in the above example , you might find it helpful to use the \"flip n multiply\" method covered first, since this will give you the full fraction form of the denominator at some point in the computations. Simplify the following expression:  Can I start by hacking off the x's? Or lopping off the 3's? Hint: No! I can only cancel off factors, not terms, so I can't do any canceling yet. The first thing I'll do is find the LCM for this expression.  The Least Common Multiple, or, for us older types, the LCD, Lowest Common Denominator of the given denominators within this complex fraction is x ï¿½ 1 x + 4 , so I'll multiply though, top and bottom, by this expression:  If you're not sure how I multiplied those factors to get the cubic results, review on multiplying polynomials. Can I now cancel off the x3's? Or cancel the 6's into the 12? Can I go inside the adding and rip out parts of some of the terms? Hint: No! Nothing cancels, so this is the final :  Simplify the following expression:  Can I start by hacking off the x ï¿½ 3's? Can I cancel the 4 with the 12? Or the 3 with the 9 or the 12? Hint: No! The common denominator for this complex fraction would be x ï¿½ 3, so I'll multiply through, top and bottom, by that.  Clearly, nothing cancels, so my final is:  It is highly unusual for a complex fraction to simplify this much, but it can happen. In this case, the \"except for x equal to 3\" part is rather important, since the original fraction is not always equal to 3 4. Indeed, it is not defined for x equal to 3 since this would cause division by zero .  Simplify the following expression:  Can I start off by canceling like this:  DON'T DO THIS!  I can only cancel factors, not terms, so the above cancellations are not proper.  The first thing I need to do is multiply through, top and bottom, by the common denominator of xy.  Then my final is: Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  Simplify the following expression:  Can I start by canceling off the 1's or the 1 t's? Hint: No! I'll multiply through, top and bottom, by the common denominator of t.  Can I cancel off the t's now? Or cancel off the 1's? Hint: No! I can only cancel off factors, not terms, and nothing factors here, so this is as simplified as it gets. The final is:    When working with complex fractions, be careful to show each step completely. Don't try to skip steps or do everything in your head. And don't get careless with cancellation; remember that you can only cancel factors, not terms. If you remember this, and do your work clearly, you should be fairly successful with these problems.    Related topics: , , Think you've found an error, a typo, or a broken link? Please . Thank you.

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  The Binomial Theorem   I  Lesson pages: The Binomial Theorem,   The Binomial Theorem is a quick way okay, a less slow way of expanding multiplying out a binomial that has been raised to some generally inconveniently large power. For instance, given 3x ï¿½ 2 10, would you want to multiply this out by hand? I know I wouldn't. Somebody figured out a formula for this expansion, and we can plug the binomial 3x ï¿½ 2 and the power 10 into that formula to get the expansion the multiplied out form of the polynomial .  The Binomial Theorem  The formal expression of the Binomial Theorem is as follows:  Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  Yeah, I know; that formula never helped me much, either. And it doesn't help that different texts use different notations to mean the same thing. That parenthetical bit has these equivalents:  Recall that the \"n!\" means \" the product of all the whole numbers between 1 and n\", so, for instance, 6! = 1ï¿½2ï¿½3ï¿½4ï¿½5ï¿½6. Then the notation \"10C7\" often pronounced as \"ten choose seven\" means:    Many calculators can evaluate this \"n choose m\" notation for you. Just look for a key that looks like \"nCm\" or \"nCr\", or for a similar item on the \"Prob\" or \"Math\" menu, or check your owner's manual under \"probability\" or \"combinations\".  The evaluation will probably look something like this:    There is another way to find the value of \"nCr\", and it's called \"Pascal's Triangle\". To make the triangle, you start with a pyramid of three 1's, like this:  Then you get the next row of numbers by adding the pairs of numbers from above. Where there is only one number above, you just carry down the 1. Keep going, always adding pairs of numbers from the previous row..  To find, say, 6C4, you go down to the row where there is a \"6\" after the initial \"1\", and then go over to the 5th not the 4th entry, to find that 6C4 = 15.  As you might imagine, drawing Pascal's Triangle every time you have to expand a binomial would be a rather long process, especially if the binomial has a large exponent on it. People have done a lot of studies on Pascal's Triangle, but in practical terms, it's probably best to just use your calculator to find nCr, rather than using the Triangle. The Triangle is cute, I suppose, but it's not terribly helpful in this context, being more time consuming than anything else. For instance, on a test, do you want to evaluate \"10C7\" by calculating eleven rows of the Triangle, or by pushing four buttons on your calculator?    I could never remember the formula for the Binomial Theorem, so instead, I just learned how it worked. I noticed that the powers on each term in the expansion always added up to whatever n was, and that the terms counted up from zero to n. Returning to our intial example of 3x ï¿½ 2 10, the powers on every term of the expansion will add up to 10, and the powers on the terms will increment by counting up from zero to 10:  3x ï¿½ 2 10 = 10C0 3x 10ï¿½0 ï¿½2 0 + 10C1 3x 10ï¿½1 ï¿½2 1 + 10C2 3x 10ï¿½2 ï¿½2 2 + 10C3 3x 10ï¿½3 ï¿½2 3 + 10C4 3x 10ï¿½4 ï¿½2 4 + 10C5 3x 10ï¿½5 ï¿½2 5 + 10C6 3x 10ï¿½6 ï¿½2 6 + 10C7 3x 10ï¿½7 ï¿½2 7 + 10C8 3x 10ï¿½8 ï¿½2 8 + 10C9 3x 10ï¿½9 ï¿½2 9 + 10C10 3x 10ï¿½10 ï¿½2 10 Note how the highlighted counter number counts up from zero to 10, with the factors on the ends of each term having the counter number, and the factor in the middle having the counter number subtracted from 10. This pattern is all you really need to know about the Binomial Theorem; this pattern is how it works.  Your first step, given a binomial to expand, should be to plug it into the Theorem, just like I did above. Don't try to do too many steps at once. Only after you've done that should you start to simplify the terms. The Binomial Theorem works best as a \"plug n chug\" process: plug in first; chug later. I've done my \"plugging\" above; now \"chugging\" gives me:  1 59049 x10 1 + 10 19683 x9 ï¿½2 + 45 6561 x8 4 + 120 2187 x7 ï¿½8 + 210 729 x6 16 + 252 243 x5 ï¿½32 + 210 81 x4 64 + 120 27 x3 ï¿½128 + 45 9 x2 256 + 10 3 x ï¿½512 + 1 1 1 1024 = 59049x10 ï¿½ 393660x9 + 1180980x8 ï¿½ 2099520x7 + 2449440x6 ï¿½ 1959552x5 + 1088640x4 ï¿½ 414720x3 + 103680x2 ï¿½ 15360x + 1024  As painful as the Binomial Theorem process is, it's still easier than trying to multiply this stuff out by hand. So don't let the Formula put you off. It's just another thing to memorize, so memorize it, at least for the next test. The biggest source of errors in the Binomial Theorem other than forgetting the Theorem is the simplification process. Don't try to do it in your head, or try to do too many steps at once. Write things out nice and clearly, as I did above, so you have a better chance of getting the right answer. And it would be good to do a bunch of practice problems, so the process is fairly automatic by the time you hit the next test.

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath  ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource Box and Whisker Plots   II  Lesson pages: ,  Interquartile Range and Outliers   Interquartile Range and  Outliers  The \"interquartile range\",  abbreviated \"IQR\", is  just the width of the box in the box and whisker plot. That is, IQR = Q3 ï¿½ Q1. The IQR can be used as a measure of how  spread out the values are. Statistics assumes that your values are clustered  around some central value. The IQR tells  how spread out the \"middle\" values are; it can also be used to tell when some of  the other values are \"too far\" from the central value. These \"too far away\"  points are called \"outliers\", because they \"lie outside\" the range in which  we expect them.  The IQR is the length of the box in your  box and whisker plot. An outlier is any value that lies more than one and a  half times the length of the box from either end of the box. That is, if a  data point is below Q1 ï¿½ 1.5ï¿½IQR or above Q3 + 1.5ï¿½IQR,  it is viewed as being too far from the central values to be reasonable. Maybe  you bumped the weigh scale when you were making that one measurement, or  maybe your lab partner is an idiot and you should never have let him touch  any of the equipment. Who knows? But whatever their cause, the outliers are  those points that don't seem to \"fit\".  Why one and a half times the  width of the box? Why does that particular value demark the difference between \"acceptable\" and \"unacceptable\" values? As near as I can tell, there isn't any reason other than that we had to draw the line somewhere,  and somebody picked 1.5ï¿½IQR as  being that line. Find the outliers, if any, for  the following data set:  10.2, 14.1, 14.4.  14.4, 14.4, 14.5, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7, 14.7, 14.7, 14.9, 15.1, 15.9,  16.4  To find out if there are any  outliers, I first have to find the IQR. There are fifteen data points, so the median will be  at position 15 + 1 ï¿½ 2 = 8. Then Q2 = 14.6.  There are seven data points on either side of the median, so Q1 is the fourth value in the list and  Q3 is the twelfth: Q1 = 14.4 and Q3 = 14.9. Then IQR = 14.9 ï¿½ 14.4 =  0.5.  Outliers will be any points  below Q1 ï¿½ 1.5ï¿½IQR = 14.4 ï¿½ 0.75 = 13.65 or above Q3 + 1.5ï¿½IQR = 14.9 + 0.75 =  15.65. Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel  2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  Then the outliers are  at 10.2, 15.9, and 16.4.   The values for Q1 ï¿½ 1.5ï¿½IQR and Q3 + 1.5ï¿½IQR are the \"fences\" that mark off  the \"reasonable\" values from the outlier values. Outliers lie outside the fences.  If your assignment is having you consider outliers and \"extreme values\", then  the values for Q1 ï¿½ 1.5ï¿½IQR and Q3 + 1.5ï¿½IQR are the \"inner\" fences and the values for Q1 ï¿½ 3ï¿½IQR and Q3 + 3ï¿½IQR are the \"outer\" fences. The  outliers marked with asterisks or open dots are between the inner and  outer fences, and the extreme values marked with whichever symbol you didn't  use for the outliers are outside the outer fences.  By the way, your book may refer to the value of \"1.5ï¿½IQR\" as being a \"step\". Then the outliers will be the numbers that are between one and two steps from the hinges, and extreme value will be the numbers that are more than two steps from the hinges.  Looking again at the previous  example, the outer fences would be at 14.4 ï¿½ 3ï¿½0.5 = 12.9 and 14.9 + 3ï¿½0.5 = 16.4. Since 16.4 is  right on the upper outer fence, this would be considered to be only an  outlier, not an extreme value. But 10.2 is fully below the lower outer fence, so 10.2 would be an extreme  value.    Your graphing calculator may or may not indicate whether a  box and whisker plot includes outliers. For instance, the above problem  includes the points 10.2, 15.9, and 16.4 as outliers. One setting on my graphing calculator  gives the simple box and whisker plot which uses only the five number  summary, so the furthest outliers are shown as being the endpoints  of the whiskers:  A different calculator  setting gives the box and whisker plot with the outliers specially  marked in this case, with a simulation of an open dot , and the  whiskers going only as far as the highest and lowest values that  aren't outliers:  Note that my calculator makes no distinction between outliers and extreme values.  If you're using your graphing  calculator to help with these plots, make sure you know which setting you're  supposed to be using and what the results mean, or the calculator may give you a perfectly correct but  \"wrong\" answer. Find the outliers and extreme  values, if any, for the following data set, and draw  the box and whisker plot. Mark any outliers with an asterisk and  any extreme values with an open dot.  21, 23, 24, 25,  29, 33, 49  To find the outliers and  extreme values, I first have to find the IQR. Since there are seven values in the  list, the median is the fourth value, so Q2 = 25. The first half of the list  is 21, 23,  24, so Q1 = 23; the second half is 29, 33, 49, so Q3 = 33. Then IQR = 33 ï¿½ 23 =  10.  The outliers will be any values  below 23 ï¿½  1.5ï¿½10 = 23 ï¿½ 15 = 8 or  above 33 +  1.5ï¿½10 = 33 + 15 = 48.  The extreme values will be those below 23 ï¿½ 3ï¿½10 = 23 ï¿½ 30 = ï¿½7 or above 33 + 3ï¿½10 = 33 + 30 =  63.  So I have an outlier at  49 but no extreme  values, I won't have  a top whisker because Q3 is also the highest non outlier, and my plot looks  like this:  It should be noted that the  methods, terms, and rules outlined above are what I have taught and what I  have most commonly seen taught. However, your course may have different  specific rules, or your calculator may do computations slightly differently. You may need to be somewhat flexible in finding the answers specific  to your curriculum.      Related topics: Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel  2000 2005 All Rights Reserved "

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  \"Coin\" Word Problems  Your uncle walks in, jingling the coins in his pocket. He grins at you and tells you that you can have the coins if you can figure out how many of each kind of coin he is carrying. You're not too interested until he tells you that he's been collecting those gold tone dollar coins. The twenty six coins in his pocket are dollars and quarters, and they add up to seventeen dollars. How many of each coin does he have? Here's how you figure it out:  There are twenty six coins in total. Some of them are dollar coins; let \"d\" stand for the number of dollar coins. The rest of the coins are quarters; let \"q\" stand for the number of quarters. Then d + q = 26.  If your uncle has only one quarter, then 25ï¿½1 = 25 cents comes from quarters. If he has two quarters, then 25ï¿½2 = 50 cents comes from quarters. Since he has q quarters, then 25ï¿½q = 25q cents comes from quarters.  For the dollar part to work, you'll have to convert to cents. That is, one dollar is one hundred cents. Since he has d dollars, then he has 100d cents from the dollar coins.  He has seventeen dollars in total, or 1700 cents, part of which is from quarters and part of which is from dollars. To help keep things straight, I'll set up a table:  number  of coins  cents  per coin  total  cents  dollars  d  100  100d  quarters  q  25  25q  total  26  1700  If you know how to solve systems of linear equations, you can see that you have the following system:  d + q = 26 100d + 25q = 1700 If you don't know about systems yet, don't worry: we're nearly done. Since we have two equations related to the same situation, I'll solve one of them and plug the result into the other one. For instance, starting with the two equations::  d + q = 26 100d + 25q = 1700 ...I'll solve the first equation above to get:  q = 26 ï¿½ d  I could have solved the first equation for d instead of for q; the end result would have been the same, though the computations would have looked different in the middle. Choosing to solve for q in this case was purely a matter of taste. Then I'll plug this into the second equation in place of q to get:  100d + 25 26 ï¿½ d = 1700  Then I'll solve:  100d + 25 26 ï¿½ d = 1700 100d + 650 ï¿½ 25d = 1700 75d + 650 = 1700 75d = 1050 d = 14 In other words, fourteen of the coins are dollar coins. Since the remainder of the twenty six coins are quarters, there are 12 quarters.    Let's do another one.  A collection of 33 coins, consisting of nickels, dimes, and quarters, has a value of $3.30. If there are three times as many nickels as quarters, and one half as many dimes as nickels, how many coins of each kind are there?  Let \"n\" stand for the number of nickels, \"d\" for the number of dimes, and \"q\" for the number of quarters. Then n + d + q = 33. Also, since the number of nickels is three times the number of quarters, then n = 3q; since the number of dimes is one half the number of nickels, then d = 0.5n = 0.5 3q = 1.5q. With these relationships, we can now re write that first equation above: n + d + q = 33 3q + 1.5q + q = 33 5.5q = 33 q = 6 Then there are six quarters, and you can work backwards to figure out that there are 9 dimes and 18 nickels.  \"But,\" you say, \"we never used the fact that the coins add up to $3.30. Shouldn't we have?\" Well, you can use that information to check your answer. You could also have used it to solve the problem in a different way. Yes, there is more than one way! Instead of dealing with the problem only in terms of how the numbers of coins related to each other, we could have dealt with how much the coins totalled to. The relationships would still have been the same q, n = 3q, and d = 1.5q , but we would have taken into account how much each coin is worth in cents ;  10d + 5n + 25q = 330 10 1.5q + 5 3q + 25q = 330 15q + 15q + 25q = 330 55q = 330 q = 6 Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  So you get the same result again.  A wallet contains the same number of pennies, nickels, and dimes. The coins total $1.44. How many of each type of coin does the wallet contain?  I'll set up some variables: number of pennies: p number of nickels: n number of dimes: d But there are an equal number of each of these, so I really have: number of pennies: p number of nickels: p number of dimes: p The value of the coins is the number of cents for each coin, times the number of that type of coin, so: value of pennies: 1p vallue of nickels: 5p value of dimes: 10p The total value is $1.44, so I'll add the above, set equal to 144 cents, and solve: 1p + 5p + 10p = 144 16p = 144 p = 9 There are nine of each type of coin in the wallet.  Remember that you can always check your answers to \"solving\" problems by plugging them back in to the original question. In this case, I would check whether nine pennies plus nine nickels plus nine dimes totalled $1.44: $0.09 + 0.45 + 0.90 = $0.54 + 0.90 = $1.44, so the solution is correct. When you have the time, this type of checking is a good idea on tests. Make sure your answer is correct before you turn it in!    The tricks to these problems are two:  convert the relationships between the numbers of coins if given, as in the second examle into equations, and  convert the statements about the values of the coins if given, as in the first example into equations that state the values all in the same unit for instance, in cents .  And, as always, label everything!    Related topics: word problems , , Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel  2000 2005 All Rights Reserved "

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  Complex Numbers   I  Lesson pages: Introduction and simplification, ,   Introduction  Up until now, you've been told that you can't take the square root of a negative number. That's because you had no numbers that, when squared, were negative. Every number was positive after you squared it. So you couldn't very well square root a negative and expect to come up with anything sensible.  Now, however, you can take the square root of a negative number, but it involves using a new number to do it. This new number was invented discovered? around the time of the Reformation. At this time, nobody believed that any \"real world\" use would be found for this new number, other than easing the computations involved in solving certain equations, so the new number was viewed as being a pretend number invented for convenience sake.  But then, when you think about it, aren't all numbers inventions? It's not like numbers grow on trees! They live in our heads. We made them all up! Why not invent a new one, as long as it works okay with what we already have? Anyway, this new number is called \"i\", standing for \"imaginary\", because \"everybody knew\" that i wasn't \"real\". That's why you couldn't take the square root of a negative number before: you only had \"real\" numbers; that is, numbers without the \"i\" in them. The imaginary is defined to be:  Then: Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  Now, you may think you can do this:  But this doesn't make any sense! You already have two numbers that square to 1; namely ï¿½1 and +1. And i already squares to ï¿½1. So it's not reasonable that i would also square to 1. This points out an important detail: When dealing with imaginaries, you gain something the ability to deal with negatives inside square roots , but you also lose something some of the flexibility and convenient rules you used to have when dealing with square roots . In particular, YOU MUST ALWAYS DO THE i PART FIRST!  Here are some examples of how imaginaries work:  Simplify sqrt ï¿½9 .  Note: This is \" \", not \"\". The i is outside the radical! Simplify sqrt ï¿½25 .  Simplify sqrt ï¿½18 .  Simplify ï¿½sqrt ï¿½6 .    Simplification  In computations, you deal with i just as you would with x, except for the fact that x2 is just x2, but i2 is ï¿½1:  Simplify 2i + 3i.  2i + 3i = 2 + 3 i = 5i  Simplify 16i ï¿½ 5i.  16i ï¿½ 5i = 16 ï¿½ 5 i = 11i  Multiply and simplify 3i 4i .  3i 4i = 3ï¿½4 iï¿½i = 12 i2 = 12 ï¿½1 = ï¿½12  Multiply and simplify i 2i ï¿½3i .  i 2i ï¿½3i = 2 ï¿½ ï¿½3 i ï¿½ i ï¿½ i = ï¿½6 i2 ï¿½ i = ï¿½6 ï¿½1 ï¿½ i = ï¿½6 ï¿½i = 6i  Note this last problem. Within it, you can see that , because i2 = ï¿½1. Continuing, you get:  This is a cycle:  In other words, to calculate any high power of i, you can convert it to a lower power by taking the closest multiple of 4 that's no bigger than the exponent and subtracting this multiple from the exponent. For example, a common trick question on tests is something along the lines of \"Simplify i99\", the idea being that you'll try to multiply i ninety nine times and you'll run out of time, and the teachers will get a good giggle at your expense in the faculty lounge. Here's how the shortcut works:  i99 = i96+3 = i 4ï¿½24 +3 = i3 = ï¿½i  That is, i99 = i3, because you can just lop off the i96. Ninety six is a multiple of four, so i96 is just 1, which you can ignore. Here are a few more examples:  Simplify i17.  i17 = i16 + 1 = i4 ï¿½ 4 + 1 = i1 = i  Simplify i120.  i120 = i4 ï¿½ 30 = 1  Simplify i64,002.  i64,002 = i64,000 + 2 = i4 ï¿½ 16,000 + 2 = i2 = ï¿½1  Now you've seen how imaginaries work; it's time to move on to complex numbers. \"Complex\" numbers have two parts, a \"real\" part being any \"real\" number that you're used to dealing with and an \"imaginary\" part being any number with an \"i\" in it . The \"standard\" format for complex numbers is \"a + bi\"; that is, real part first and i part last.      Related topics: , the , the Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel  2000 2005 All Rights Reserved "

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra  Resource Box and Whisker Plots   I  Lesson pages: Quartiles, Boxes, and Whiskers,    Quartiles, Boxes, and Whiskers  Statistics assumes that your data points the numbers in  your list are clustered around some central value. The \"box\" in the box and whisker plot contains,  and thereby highlights, the middle half of these data points.  To create a box and whisker plot, you start by ordering  your data putting the values in numerical order , if they aren't ordered already. Then you find  the of your data. The median divides the data into two halves. To divide the data  into quarters, you then find the medians of these two halves. Note: If you have an even number of  values, so the first median was the average of the two middle values, then you include the middle  values in your sub median computations. If you have an odd number of values, so the first median was  an actual data point, then you do not include that value in your sub median computations. That is, to  find the sub medians, you're only looking at the values that haven't yet been used.  You have three points: the first middle point the median , and the  middle points of the two halves what I call the \"sub medians\" . These three points divide the entire data set into quarters, called \"quartiles\". The top point of each quartile has a name, being a \"Q\"  followed by the number of the quarter. So the top point of the first quarter of the data points is  \"Q1\", and so forth.  Note that Q1 is also the middle number for the first half of the list, Q2 is also the middle  number for the whole list, Q3 is the middle number for the second half of the list, and Q4 is the largest value in  the list.  Once you have these three points, Q1, Q2, and Q3, you have all you need  in order to draw a simple box and whisker plot. Here's an example of how it works.  Draw a box and whisker plot for the following data set:  4.3, 5.1, 3.9, 4.5, 4.4, 4.9, 5.0,  4.7, 4.1, 4.6, 4.4, 4.3, 4.8, 4.4, 4.2, 4.5, 4.4  My first step is to order the set. This gives  me:  3.9, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.3, 4.4, 4.4, 4.4, 4.4,  4.5, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1  The first number I need is the median of the entire set.  Since there are seventeen values in this list, I need the ninth value:  3.9, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.3, 4.4, 4.4,  4.4, 4.4, 4.5, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1  The median is Q2 = 4.4.  The next two numbers I need are the medians of the two  halves. Since I used the \"4.4\" in the middle of the list, I  can't re use it, so my two remaining data sets are:  3.9, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.3, 4.4, 4.4,  4.4 and 4.5, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1  The first half has eight values, so the median is the  average of the middle two:  Q1 = 4.3 + 4.3 2 = 4.3  The median of the second half is: Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights  Reserved  Q3 = 4.7 + 4.8 2 = 4.75  Since my list values have one decimal  place and range from 3.9  to 5.1, I won't use a scale  of, say, zero to ten, marked off by ones. Instead, I'll draw a number line from 3.5 to  5.5, and mark off by tenths.  Now I'll mark off the minimum and maximum values, and Q1, Q2, and  Q3:  The \"box\" part of the plot goes from Q1 to Q3:  And then the \"whiskers\" are drawn to the  endpoints:  By the way, box and whisker plots don't have to be drawn  horizontally as I did above; they can be vertical, too.   Terminology: The top end of your box may also be called  the \"upper hinge\"; the lower end may also be called the \"lower hinge\". The lower hinge is also  called \"the 25th percentile\"; the median is \"the 50th percentile\"; the upper hinge is \"the 75th percentile\". This means  that 25%, 50% and 75%  of the data, respectively, is at or below that point.  The IQR may also be referred to as the \"H spread\". And the box and whisker plot may  include a cross or an \"X\" marking the value of the data, in addition to  the line inside the box that marks the median. The difference between the \"X\" and the  median line can then be used as a measure of \"skew\".  Please don't ask me to explain \"skew\".    Draw the box and whisker plot for the following data  set: 77, 79, 80, 86, 87, 87, 94, 99  My first step is to find the median. Since there are  eight data points, the median will be the average of the two middle values: 86 + 87 ï¿½ 2 = 86.5 = Q2  This splits the list into two halves: 77, 79, 80, 86 and 87, 87, 94, 99. Since the halves of the data set each contain an even  number of values, the sub medians will be the average of the middle  two values.  Q1 =  79 + 80 ï¿½ 2 = 79.5  Q3 = 87 + 94 ï¿½ 2 = 90.5  The minimum value is 77 and the maximum value is 99, so I have:  min: 77, Q1: 79.5,  Q2: 86.5, Q3:  90.5, max: 99  Then my plot looks like this:  As you can see, you only need the five values listed above  min, Q1, Q2,  Q3, and max in order to draw your box and whisker plot. This set of five values has been given  the name \"the five number summary\".  Give the five number summary of the following data  set: 79, 53, 82, 91, 87, 98, 80,  93  The five number summary consists of the numbers I need  for the box and whisker plot: the minimum value, Q1  the bottom of the box , Q2 the median of the  set , Q3 the top of the box , and the maximum value which is also Q4 . So I need to order  the set, find the median and the sub medians, and then list the required values in order.  ordering the list: 53, 79, 80, 82, 87, 91, 93, 98, so the minimum is 53 and the maximum is  98  finding the median: 82 + 87 ï¿½ 2 = 84.5 = Q2  lower half of the list: 53, 79, 80, 82, so Q1 = 79 + 80 ï¿½ 2 = 79.5  upper half of the list: 87, 91, 93, 98, so Q3 = 91 + 93 ï¿½ 2 = 92  five number summary: 53, 79.5, 84.5, 92, 98  Part of the point of a box and whisker plot is to show how  spread out your values are. But what if one or another of your values is way out of line? For this, we  need to consider \"outliers\"....      Related topics: Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights  Reserved "

There are many other practical uses for complexes, but you'll have to wait for more interesting classes like \"Engineering 201\" to get to the \"good stuff\". Remember that the Quadratic Formula solves \"ax2 + bx + c = 0\" for the values of x. Also remember that this means that you are trying to find the x intercepts of the graph. When the Formula gives you a negative inside the square root, you can now simplify the zero by using complex numbers. The answer you come up with is a valid \"zero\" or \"root\" or \"solution\" for \"ax2 + bx + c = 0\", because, if you plug it back into the quadratic, you'll get zero after you simplify. but you cannot graph a complex number on the x,y plane. So this \"solution to the equation\" is not an x intercept. In other words, you can make this connection between the Quadratic Formula, complex numbers, and graphing:  x2 ï¿½ 2x ï¿½ 3  x2 ï¿½ 6x + 9  x2 + 3x + 3  a positive number inside the square root  zero inside the square root  a negative number inside the square root  two real solutions  one repeated real solution  two complex solutions  two distinct x intercepts  one repeated x intercept  no x intercepts    Graphing complex numbers  As an aside, you can graph complexes, but not in the x,y plane. You need the \"complex\" plane. For the complex plane, the x axis is where you plot the real part, and the y axis is where you graph the imaginary part. For instance, for the complex number 3 ï¿½ 2i, you would graph it like this:  Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  This leads to an interesting fact: When you learned about regular \"real\" numbers, you also learned about their order this is what you show on the number line . But x,y points don't come in any particular order. You can't say that one point \"comes after\" another point in the same way that you can say that one number comes after another number. For instance, you can't say that 4, 5 \"comes after\" 4, 3 \" in the way that you can say that 5 comes after 3. Pretty much all you can do is compare \"size\", and, for complex numbers, \"size\" means \"how far from the origin\". To do this, you use the Distance Formula, and compare which complexes are closer to or further from the origin. This \"size\" concept is called \"the modulus\". For instance, looking at our complex number plotted above, its modulus is computed by using the Distance Formula:  Note that all points at this distance from the origin have the same modulus. All the points on the circle with radius sqrt 13 are viewed as being complex numbers having the same \"size\" as 3 ï¿½ 2i.

But whatever method you use, remember that multiplying and adding with complexes works just like multiplying and adding polynomials, except that, while x2 is just x2, i2 is ï¿½1. That is, you can use the exact same techniques for simplifying complex number expressions, but you can simplify even further with complexes than with polynomials, because i2 reduces to the number ï¿½1.    Rationalizing denominators  Adding and multiplying complexes isn't too bad. It's when you start on fractions that is, division that things turn ugly. Most of the reason for this ugliness is actually arbitrary. Remember back in elementary school, when you first learned fractions? Your teacher would get her panties in a wad if you used \"improper\" fractions. For instance, you couldn't say \" 3 2 \"; you had to convert it to \"1 1 2\". But now that you're in algebra, nobody cares, and you've probably noticed that \"improper\" fractions are often more useful than \"mixed\" fractions. The problem in the case of complexes is that your professor will get his boxers in a bunch if you leave imaginaries in the denominator. So how do you handle this?  Suppose you have the following problem: Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  Simplify The point here is that they want you to get rid of the i underneath. The 2 is fine, but the i has got to go. To do this, you use the fact that i2 = ï¿½1. If you multiply top and bottom by i, then the i underneath will vanish in a puff of negativity: So the answer is ï¿½ 3 2 i.  This was simple enough, but what if you have something more complicated?  Simplify If you multiply top and bottom by i, you get: Since you still have an i underneath, this didn't help much. So how do you handle this simplification? You use something called \"conjugates\". The conjugate of a complex number a + bi is the same number, but with the opposite sign in the middle: a ï¿½ bi. When you multiply conjugates, you are, in effect, multiplying to a difference of squares: Note that the i's disappeared. This is what the conjugate, difference of squares thing is for. Here's how it is used: So the answer is 6 5 ï¿½ 3 5 i.  In the last step, note how the fraction was split into two pieces. This is because, technically speaking, a complex number is in two parts, the real part and the i part. They aren't supposed to \"share\" the denominator.

    "fileDetails": " Purplemath ï¿½ Your Algebra Resource  Cramer's Rule  Given a system of linear equations, Cramer's Rule is a handy way to solve for just one of the variables without having to solve the whole system of equations. They don't usually teach Cramer's Rule this way, but this is supposed to be the point of the Rule. Instead of solving the whole system, you can use Cramer's to solve for just one variable.  Look at the following system of equations:  2x + y + z = 3 x ï¿½ y ï¿½ z = 0 x + 2y + z = 0 Looking at the system, you have the left hand side with the variables and the right hand side with the answer values. Let D be the determinant of the coefficient matrix of the above system, and let Dx be the determinant formed by replacing the x column values with the answer column values. That is:  system of equations  coefficient matrix's determinant  answer column  Dx: coefficient determinant with answer column values in x column  2x + 1y + 1z = 3 1x ï¿½ 1y ï¿½ 1z = 0 1x + 2y + 1z = 0 Similarly, Dy and Dz would then be: Copyright ï¿½ Elizabeth Stapel 2000 2005 All Rights Reserved  Evaluating each determinant, you get:  Cramer's Rule says that x = Dx ï¿½ D, y = Dy ï¿½ D, and z = Dz ï¿½ D. That is:  x = 3 3 = 1, y = ï¿½6 3 = ï¿½2, and z = 9 3 = 3  That's all there is to Cramer's Rule. To find whichever variable you want call it \"ï¿½\" or \"beta\" , just evaluate the determinant quotient Dï¿½ ï¿½ D. Please don't ask me to explain why this works. Just trust me that determinants can work many kinds of magic. Given the following system of equations, find the value of z.  2x + y + z = 1 x ï¿½ y + 4z = 0 x + 2y ï¿½ 2z = 3 To solve only for z, I first find the coefficient determinant.  Then I form Dz by replacing the third column of values with the answer column:  Then I form the quotient and simplify:  z = 2  The point of Cramer's Rule is that you don't have to solve the whole system to get the one value you need. This saved me a fair amount of time on some physics tests. I forget what we were working on something with wires and currents, I think , but Cramer's Rule was so much faster than any other solution method and God knows I needed the extra time . Don't let all the subscripts and stuff confuse you; the Rule is really pretty simple. You just pick the variable you want to solve for, replace that variable's column of values in the coefficient determinant with the answer column's values, evaluate that determinant, and divide by the coefficient determinant. That's all there is to it.  Almost.  What if the coefficient determinant is zero? You can't divide by zero, so what does this mean? I can't go into the technicalities here, but \"D = 0\" means that the system of equations has no unique solution. The system may be inconsistent no solution or dependent a parametric solution such as \" a, a + 3, a ï¿½ 4 \" . In terms of Cramer's Rule, \"D = 0\" means that you'll have to use some other method such as matrix row operations to solve the system. If D = 0, you can't use Cramer's Rule.

    "fileDetails": " NIGERIAN TALKING DRUM ESEMBLE Arts Evidence Guide ARTISTIC PERCEPTION African music is always approached through rhythm rather than melody; beats rather than notes. Lessons begin with the presentation of four different drums, their respective names, tones and the different patterns each of them produces. Once phrasing on all the drums are mastered, students go on to learn how tones are generated on each drum. Finally, the combination of the four different patterns are shown to form a rhythmic statement. CREATIVE EXPRESSION Students who are motivated to a deeper understanding combine drumming with singing Yoruba songs. Yet another level is reached through the study of dance, whereupon it can be realized that the drumming, singing, and dancing, are unique ways of articulating the same expression. It is at this point that students begin to create their own simple rhythmic phrasing constructions. HISTORIC AND CULTURAL CONTEXT The history of Yoruba music has been significant both in a social and a spiritual context. Students will be able to differentiate secular from ritual music, and understand itsâ role in different celebrations. In addition, they will begin to note the similarities and differences between their music and the music of other cultures and will begin to compare and contrast them. AESTHETIC VALUING After class discussions and critiques, students will be able to make an analysis of a simple musical performance and gain confidence in communicating their own opinions. CONNECTIONS, RELATIONSHIP APPLICATIONS Students will be able to correlate the use of elements in music to other art forms. For example, the aforementioned patterns can be related to those found in fabric prints, paintings, and in graphic design as well as science. They will also witness and experience the process musicians and composers go through to create music. They will identify the similarities that choreographers and dancers experience while creating dance drama. The talking drum goes beyond entertainment into a special realm of direct communication and therefore is functional in offering another valuable language to the student.

He does this masterfully through the performance and teaching of African Music and Dance and the sharing of principles from the heart of African family life. Together with his wife, lead dancer Omowale, Francis Awe formed The Nigerian Talking Drum Ensemble in 1985 in response to a growing international interest in this unique form of drumming. He has performed in Mexico, Germany, India, and extensively in the United States. Currently based in Los Angeles, the Ensemble has appeared at the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Bower Museum, and Disneyland, as well as at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, the Hollywood Bowl and many other major cultural festivals. Bringing the richness and wisdom of his culture directly to children is also Francis Awe's passionate desire. He has spent much time and energy as a teacher, workshop leader and cultural guide. In this capacity he has been able to reach people of all ages and backgrounds, including those in the penal system. His hope and inspiration is to establish a permanent Cultural Center where African music and dance and its underlying message can be presented on a continuing basis.

She studied Ghanaian dance under Kobla and Dzizobe Ledzekpo. While continuing her study of Ghanaian dance in the African Ensemble class at the California Institute for the Arts, Omowale met Francis Awe. There, Francis began coaching her in the Yoruba dance style. Omowale has been principal dancer and assistant director of The Nigerian Talking Drum Ensemble since its inception in 1985. She instructs and choreographs for the Ensemble's adult and youth corps. For Omowale, dance is not just an art form. Whether it is the mystical dance for Obatala the god of peace and purity ; the passionate beauty of the dance of Sango the god of thunder ; or the social dance of Sabada in praise of the God within each of us; Omowale considers dance a medium for healing the mind, body, soul and spirit of all people. She also feels the art form has a unifying effect. \"We have all people represented in our Ensemble: African Americans, Anglos, Asians, Latinos,\" she points out. \"The Ensemble is one global family. If we can get this family together in complete harmony, then maybe global unity is possible.\" Omowale is life partner to Francis Awe. The husband and wife have two children and live in Los Angeles, where they continue to educate and entertain audiences of all ages about Nigerian traditions and culture through their music, song and dance.

    "fileDetails": "Francis Awe and the Nigerian Talking Drum Ensemble THE NIGERIAN TALKING DRUM ENSEMBLE Francis Awe, Director Omowale Orisayomi, Assistant Director The Nigerian Talking Drum Ensemble was founded in 1985 by Master Drummer Francis Awe, in response to the growing international interest in the Talking Drum. Since it's inception, the Ensemble of drummers and dancers has educated and entertained audiences worldwide. The Yoruba name for the Talking Drum is Dundun, which means \"sweet sound.\" It is called the Talking Drum because its sound emulates the tonal quality of the Yoruba language. Currently based in Los Angeles, The Ensemble has performed at such landmark venues as the J. Paul Getty Museum, Disneyland, the Los Angeles Theatre Center, and the Celebration for Nelson Mandela at the Los Angeles Coliseum; as well as at major cultural festivals such as the African Marketplace, the Los Angeles Festival and the World Festival of Sacred Music. Since 1995, the Ensemble has performed its annual \"Day of Remembrance, Day of Healing,\" to celebrate and commemorate the survival of African and Yoruba culture, and its unifying influence throughout the world. As Francis Awe notes on the African Heritage Network's 1997 broadcast of \"African Portraits.\": \"You can still hear the root of African music in any music anywhere in the world today.\" It is the legacy of that music that inspires the Ensemble and destines it to reunify the human race regardless of color or language, through its music, song and dance. The Nigerian Talking Drum Ensemble is available for lecture demonstrations, workshops, touring and performances. The sound of the Talking Drum and Yoruba song can be heard on the CD, \"Oro Ijinle\" Deep Words , Francis Awe's first recording on Bindu Records. Future goals include the establishment of a permanent Cultural Center where African music and dance can be presented and archived on a continuous basis.

    "fileDetails": " THE NIGERIAN TALKING DRUM ENSEMBLE  SCHOOL PROGRAM  The Nigerian Talking Drum Ensemble was founded and is directed by Francis Awe, a Master Drummer from Nigeria. He is not just a drummer, but a philosopher and an African traditional spiritualist. Aside from being a philosophical and religious drummer he was also born into a royal family. In Nigeria, particularly within the Yoruba ethnic group, anyone with this birthright is uniquely Recognized. The four principal elements of African life, philosophy, religion, politics and morale are highly reflected or manifested in the music performed by this ensemble. According to Mr. Awe, there are three types of musicians: 1 those who are born into the family of musicians; 2 those who learn music by rote; and, 3 those that are chosen by the drums. Francis belongs to two of these categories. He was born into a renown drumming family and also sees himself as a \"drum chosen man.\" As a result of this, Mr. Awe always says the talking drumming is his life, his mission and not a trade. \"My music goes beyond entertainment. It is a revelation of hidden myths.\" The music is destined for the re unification of all human races whatever their color and the language they speak. \"My music goes beyond entertainment. It is a revelation of hidden myths.\" . Consequently, Mr. Awe tells his students that if they come only to study the sounds and patterns on the talking drum, he may not be the proper person to learn from. Music to him is more than a sound product, it requires observing and practicing what is played on the drums. Thus learning the talking drum demands a lot of discipline from whoever is called to study it. No discrimination, racism, prejudice is allowed within the group. The music is destined for the reunification of all human races whatever their color and the language they speak  The Nigerian Talking Drum Ensemble was employed in August of 1989 by the Performing Tree to perform in different schools from kindergarten to the university level, to share its rich Nigerian tradition and cultures, through music, dance and song with its audience of different categories throughout Los Angeles County. The performances take different forms and shapes, ranging from lectures, lecture demonstrations and full performances. The following are the sequence of the different dances for the school performances: 1 \"Ekaabo se daadaa le de.\" This is a processional number in which the group welcomes its audience. After welcoming the audience, they ask, \"How was your arrival? Hope there was no problem on your way here.\" They ask and also assure them that there will be no problem on their way back. This number is performed to show the audience the importance of greeting in Nigeria, especially among the Yorubas. Greetings are the first symbols of love. Therefore, when people greet, they greet from the bottom of their hearts. The greeting is done cheerfully, happily, and submissively and the answering takes the same characteristic. After the speaker tells the audience the meaning and the purpose of the Yoruba greetings, she asks her audience to look at the people sitting beside them and with their faces, say, \"E kaab o.\" When this is done, everybody feels great and happy. They all have a sense of belonging. 2 \"Obatala\" is the Yoruba god of purity and peace. Obatala is the god who is second in command to Olodumare Supreme Being . He is the oldest deity and the most experienced among the divinities. The speaker explains the qualities of Obatala. He does not take any bloody sacrifice, does not fight, does not cheat, does not steal, does not tell lies, does not drink alcohol, does not smoke and finally, does not take any kind of drugs at symbol of his purity, the dancers use white cloths called Ala. For the adults, this number is also used to invoke the spirit of Orisha for blessing, peace, and prosperity. Obatala's qualities include bringing all people together regardless of their differences. It is he who molds everyone and he brought the earth to the world for human survival. On the land, there is water, plants and animals. Through the land, all humans are sheltered, fed and nourished. From it, we all come and into it we shall return. Therefore, we are all connected and belong to one very large family. \"Obatala\"  the Yoruba god of purity and peace  3 \"Drumming and Interpretation\". This number is performed for two reasons. The first is to show how the \"dundun\" drum is used as a speech surrogate. Mr. Awe tells the students that the talking drum was invented a long time ago when people could neither read nor write. There was no radio, television, newspaper or telephone. The talking drum was used to send messages. 'A long time ago when people could neither read nor write, and there was no radio, television, newspaper or telephone, the talking drum was used to send messages.'  The second reason is the message in the piece itself whose theme is \"A tree cannot make a forest.\" Everything played here is a proverb whose translation and interpretation is full of meaning for the whole audience. The lesson of the piece is than nobody is self sufficient. We all rely on one another to succeed in life. Our colors, races, languages, or property do not make us superior to any other person. We need to help one another and share with all people. \"A tree cannot make a forest.\" Nobody is self sufficient. We all rely on one another to succeed in life.  4 From number one to this point, the group works alone, while the audience is asked to watch and observe because they will be asked to participate. After the \"saabada\" dance, it is time for students to show how much they understand what they observed. In this section, Mr. Awe teaches the student audience how the drum talks, how to recognize what the drum says, and plays some of the costumes names, which have also been taught through the performance, for them to translate. The students answer through the raising of their hands. And soon the right answers are given. There is always hailing, cheering and excitement. Everyone get up and dance!  The next item is the playing of drum patterns: Simple patterns are selected from the \"aluda\" to teach the student how music is learned in Nigeria. Mr. Awe teaches the assembly including their teachers by dividing them into three groups, each group will play one pattern separately first, and later, they will play together, but with individual groups playing its own patterns. The reason for this is to show the students how simple it is for one person to play a pattern and the difficulty in relating one pattern to the other. But when time is taken to relate, there will be mutual joy, harmony and oneness. The lesson here is true of life. If all people can forget their differences and accept individuals for what they are, what a progressive world we could form. There would be unity, joy, harmony, and everybody would be happy.  5 The last of this series is the participation of students and their teachers in dance movement. Here, a dancer teaches all the simple steps. The crowd is always excited here. It is the beginning of the climax of our performance. Before the last dance, we ask the students a few questions about what was taught them through the performance. These include the geographical location of Nigeria, the two types of seasons in Africa, the way the Yoruba dress and why they dress that way. There are also questions about the talking drum and the costumes the group wear. We end the performance with the \"Shango\" dance, which is fast and strong. This number shows the students the clash of power between the African drummers and dancers. Each of them claims to be greater than the other. After this number, the audience feels reluctant to leave. We conclude with the introduction of the individual members of the ensemble through a soft and wavy music. copyright 1999 2001, Francis Awe  "
